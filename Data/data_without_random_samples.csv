401500,Studio 7.0 LTE - Smartphone - GSM Unlocked - White,BLU,,5,"I LOVE this Smartphone(Phablet)! I have high end cellphones such as iPhone 6plus & samsung note Edge. I am not seeing any lag time between apps. Fairly responsive. Only delay I found was when opened multi windows at once, then it took couple seconds to catch up. Camera actually not that horrible, had to download different camera app, so I could use front camera app. I bought a external flash attachment and that improved camera quality quiet a bit. I am impressed with the size of this. It's a lot skinner than I expected. I took a photo so you could get a size comparison between iPhone 6plus and this. I also took a photo of my dog in the evening with the external flash that plugs into my earbud port. The front photos so, so, but actually usable with me using external flash to take a selfie. The sound quality is really good!! When I called or listen it came across clear and loud. Same with the music!! Only thing I wish it had was better ways to control loudness!! I had no issues or problem getting 4g/H+ to work. I loaded my books, had to twik the size and font to fit the screen, but not a big issue. Also movies play great, no lag time, even with netflix! For 200 dollars, it is worth every penny!! I even sold my cellphone to buy this!",70.0

My S4 had a cracked screen and it was starting to have problems with the touch sensitivity.After a few months of having this phone I started having issues with lagging and freezing.I make sure to not overload the phone with apps, photos, etc. The phone lags with apps, internet, even with non-data or wifi related functions like texts and the camera.The phone will often lock up and will act like it's restarted, even though I didn't restart it.Very frustrated. From now on will only buy new electronics. Buying refurbished is too much of a risk.",0.0

I tried and tried thinking it was my provider(cricket) but after some research I found out it was not a 4g lte phone. But a lower grade and the reason it wouldn't keep a signal is because it was Trying to find a tower that supported it that wasn't lte. So after all this and extreme disappointment because I really liked the phone it was pretty and big ( front camera kinda sucked) but it had pretty good features. I just had to return it.,0.0

The remote shutter control thing is kinda neat (when it works), allowing you to use the watch to trigger the camera on your phone remotely.Almost no customization of the watch face, fonts, backgrounds, etc. The only saving grace is that it's as cheap as a lot of non smart watches, and it does seem to keep time.",3.0

I have never heard of Blu Studio so I was curious. I had read several reviews from customers and was please the majority of the reviews I read were very favorable. I decided to buy the Blue Studio 5.0 HD in pink. I have had it now for about two weeks and I love it. Setting up the phone was easy. I just popped my slim card in from my iphone and I was up and running. I love the large screen, great volume, excellent picture taking and 4G speed. I have no complaints. My 19 year old daughter was also in the market for a new phone and recommended the Blu Studio 5.0 HD and she loves it. She said she couldn't be happier and we both love the affordable cost. We are so glad we didn't spend a lot of money on one of the other top cellphones on the market. I will definitely buy a another Blu Studio in the future when I'm ready four another upgrade again.

I was looking forward to the better quality camera in addition to the larger phone overall. With prime, I got the phone the next day and was thrilled. The look and feel of the phone far exceeded my expectations and I was happy at first. But that quickly faded as the first day I realized the speaker quality is really poor on this particular phone. My son went all over the Internet looking at reviews trying to find out if this was a flaw in this particular model or maybe I got a lemon. None of the reviews mentioned anything regarding the volume being low on this phone so we tried different things. Nothing worked. I have slight hearing loss, very slight, but this was ridiculous. I tried to deal with it because I did like the phone very much. However, on the 29th day, the speaker went out completely. The phone would ring and there was no sound at all. Thankfully, I was able to return it and get a complete refund. I am a little sad and wish it was not sold through a 3rd party seller though because in that case I would probably risk trying another one if it was through Amazon itself. I did love most of the features of the phone. The responsiveness of the screens was not as fast at the 5.5 though.",2.0

This phone has excellent voice clarity, and seems to find a strong signal where ever I go. The interface took a little getting used to, but now I navigate around on it without problem. I'm 51, and I like how I can use it without needing my reading glasses. The camera takes decent (not great) shots, but is very easy to use. I did need to call AT&T and have data blocked on the phone, because I don't subscribe to a data service plan and AT&T loves when you use it anyway to charge a small fortune per KB. The phone works great on wi-fi, and synchs easily to my Outlook 2010 calender and task list. The GPS takes awhile to find satellites, but then works very well with spoken turn-by-turn directions that equal my Garmin. The keyboard is small, but my thumbnails always seem to end up hitting the right key. Overall I'm very pleased. I wish I had taken this path much sooner than I did.",0.0

I upgraded from E62, so initial difference was huge. But once I got to use more features over the months, I realize this is no ordinary phone.What I like:1. Awesome build quality, no moving parts, no squeaky sound, top quality materials2. Probably the best form factor smart phone in the world. Not too narrow so it will slip from hand, not too wide to bulge out from pockets, easily fits regular sized palm. Easy to type messages, emails with one hand3. If there was a fashion show for smart phones, E71 would win it hands down. I got steel and gray and it looks serious business and smart stylist at the same time.4. Battery, battery, battery. It lasts me 3 days on one charge with good about of browsing, phone calls, skype and push email (sync-ed hourly)5. Call quality is top notch, as expected from a high end Nokia product, with excellent clarity.6. Very good speaker, for use as Speakerphone or playing music or read messages automatically.7. Beautiful, crisp screen. I miss the big screen on my earlier E62 and I think it was the best small screen ever for watching movies, videos etc. E71 has the same screen quality but only slightly smaller due to phone size8. Processor and Symbian S60 3rd Edition work great together and menu navigation, apps run fast on E719. Nokia calendar and Message notification on home screen keeps my life totally in control. After I got this phone, my laptop sits closed for weeks. This phone will let you ""work from phone""10. Documents processing - I edit Word and Excel docs on this phone, also read documents in pdf. No problem whatsoever.11. Add on apps for Symbian enables me to be constantly be in touch with family, friends and the world. I installed France24 for live news, Google Mobile for searching, maps. I installed Fring to use Skype, Google talk Twitter all on one interface. I use MobiReader for reading ebooks12. Nokia's free email (Nokia Messaging) client has a crisp, beautiful interface. I like it even better than Gmail for mobile. Sync is customizable (frequency, how much email etc)13. FM radio is excellent, although not many probably use it. I catch my channels when workload is light.What I don't like:1. E71 comes with basic cheap earphones, you might need to upgrade to something better, preferably with Bluetooth wireless2. Camera is not great, but I don't use it much3. Nokia's Ovi store does not have much content. There are not many professional looking themes. But you could downloaded nice themes from S60 app sitesOverall, I don't think there are many smart phones (or even phones) out there that stack up to E71. Go and get it. If you can, buy the unlocked E71 and not E71x from AT&T that is loaded with slow bloatware.",2.0

91176,"BlackBerry Curve 8310 Phone, Red (AT&T)",BlackBerry,49.0,5,"I've had such a good time already with this Blackberry. If this phone would last forever, it's the last one I'd buy. It's the first Blackberry I've ever owned and I have next to no complaints. Here is my more specific feedback, including some help with AT&T:1. If you're tethered to your laptop through your Blackberry and the internet just seems to lock up, chances are the website either overloaded the system (ex. large streaming videos) or maybe you've even received a phone call at the same time but it couldn't get through. The phone does act as your modem for your internet to the laptop so I've experienced that you can't be online and receive calls at the same time. (See solution for this in my #2). I've even thought to change my voicemail to say something about, ""There's a possibility I'm using the internet so please leave a voicemail otherwise I won't know you called....""2. If your internet does get locked up on the laptop AND the Blackberry, keep your phone on, take the battery out for 10 seconds and then put it all back together. The phone will automatically power back on and you'll see an hour glass turning for a while on your screen. If it lasts quite a while (more than 2 minutes) be patient and give it a little more time. It will come back to normal and you'll see the desktop with all your icons soon. I find this needs to happen almost daily if I'm using the tethering feature to my laptop. I'd say this is one of my only complaints because it's like you're rebooting now and then and I didn't expect that would happen when I bought this. The recovery isn't TOO bad though so I'm living with it.3. If you're trying to make a phone call while driving BE CAREFUL!!! I don't know about you but I don't have hardly any phone numbers memorized so you have to scroll and dig into the address book to get to your contact (if saved). Between small buttons on the keyboard in combination with having to give more attention to what you're scrolling through, it can be very dangerous. Make sure you're doing this as the car is stopped and even consider pulling over!!!4. In reviews I read before buying this Blackberry there were people who were disgruntled about AT&T wireless. I don't know if they've changed their entire customer service crew but I'm here to tell you that I've now had over the past few months some of THE best customer service about five times in a row. This customer service overshadowed just about any industry's customer service and it was all sought out straight from the AT&T customer service phone line. You can reach them by dialing 611 on your phone.5. I noticed the instruction pamphlet that comes with the phone is super simple for helping you explore things. If you have the time to explore throughout some of the folders on your desktop I think you'll find all kinds of applications that do seem logical in the folders they're in. But to get there, you do end up having to take some time that a lot of people just don't have. When I know something should have a feature on it I can't stop until I've found it. If you continue struggling to find what you're looking for you can call customer service or look into simple books like ""Blackberry for Dummies"". They might be able to expand on what the compact instruction pamphlet cannot.6. I'm kind of bummed the snooze alarm for the alarm (clock icon) has a max 10 minute time frame. I would have thought they'd allow you to customize that time and they don't. I'll live...7. If you've placed your SIM card from your previous phone into this Blackberry but you go to the address book (Rolodex icon) and you can't find your saved contacts, all you have to do is hit the blackberry button (just left of the roller ball) and it should have the option for ""SIM Phone Book"". You'll probably need to scroll down before you're going to find that on the pull down menu.8. There was some feedback online I read saying that AT&T limits the amount of data you can transfer back and forth through internet usage on your blackberry. I don't know about all internet plans but the key word you want to look for when choosing one is ""UNLIMITED DATA"" to avoid overage and expensive bills. The one I chose has unlimited data and tethering to my laptop for $60/mo. But, don't forget to add on an additional plan for your text messages! Texts are not included with the internet plan. The text plan I chose was only $5.00/mo.I truly feel spoiled with my new Blackberry Curve. Finally I feel like I've got quality, convenience and luxury all in the palm of my hand. That's been so nice. Mission accomplished.",5.0

Unlocked - Black - 16GB - U.S. Warranty,Motorola,249.0,5,"I have been paying $600+ for iPhones for the past several years and am thrilled that I have switched to much more affordable phone that functions comparable to the phones I have had in the past. I am a critical reviewer and consider myself very ""tech saavy.""My biggest concern with buying a more budget-friendly phone was that I would sacrifice camera quality and response time. I own a professional DSLR camera but recognize that with my 4 boys I don't often carry around my $800 camera. As a result, the picture quality that I take with my phone is important to me. The Moto G Plus has an autofocus feature that combines with the Octocore Processor and increased RAM to produce high quality pictures.Combining the great pictures and video with the 5.5 inch screen has made this product a great purchase for me.Additional notes: Fingerprint scanner and all other features of the phone have worked great! No lag...seamless transitions...great screen! 64 Gb is twice as much as I would have received than an overpriced iPhone",4.0

Things I was searching for and I like best about this phone. Price: much better price than comparable phones, and this phone is also better in many ways. RAM 3G! with a fast processor. ROM 64 G without any real boat that cannot be easily removed. Net available is about 55G. PLUS an SD card slot. Camera is great, but I am not a photo junkie so you might not love it but 24M is really sharp and better than most at this price. 6"" screen and super vivid. Easy to use with reading apps and easy to hold onto. Finger print scanner works great. NFC and android pay work great. Some of the pre-installed software is actually useful, such as Amazon App Store and the keyboard app has a number pad. Nice things included: silicon case, NFC marks to set up your own NFC commands, headphones like the iphone has. Big enough battery. Very nice speakers that are about as good as my Bluetooth portable speakers. Android 5.1. Works with my BYOP, which is currently Tracfone, BTW I love the warehouse buying option!",1.0

250962,Motorola Moto E (1st Generation) - Black - 4 GB - Global GSM Unlocked Phone,Motorola,109.99,5,CHECK THE OS BEFORE YOU BUY.The unlocked Moto E Global GSM is a great phone and I'm very happy overall with the purchase. But one precaution I neglected before purchasing was to check the operating system. I assumed it would be loaded with stock Android 4.4.4 (KitKat). I.e. System Version = ...retail.... Instead the phone was loaded with a System Version from Cricket. I now have two OS related issues:1) Hotspot Not Working - I think Cricket disabled the hotspot functionality in the OS because I cannot see the Portable Wi-Fi hotspot option. The hotspot worked fine on my previous phone on T-Mobile. Motorola does not offer a stock Android 4.4.4 that I can reload. I may have to resort to some third-party website for the stock OS.2) Wi-Fi Calling Not Available - Apparently T-Mobile has to add a lot of code to the OS for Wi-Fi calling. But T-Mobile does not sell the Moto E so I can't get the software from them. I'll probably use Vonage for Wi-Fi calling. My existing Vonage plan allows the service to be used on two mobile phones without additional charge.,2.0
400219,Star 4.5 Global GSM(Pink),BLU,85.09,2,"I bought this phone specifically to use while traveling in Europe. The first issue that I noticed was simply how slow the phone was....15-20 seconds to open most apps (Gmail, facebook, uber, google maps). The second issue was that I trusted a previous reviewer who stated they got 4G speeds in Europe. To be clear this phone does not have 4G/LTE capabilities. Only 3G speeds.I was able to successfully use this phone in the Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, and Sweden. Due to the speed issues of loading apps and download speeds I primarily used this phone as a mobile hotspot using data-only sim cards purchased in each country. However battery life is quite poor...lasting less about ~4 hours when used as a mobile hotspot.Overall, if you're looking for a cheap phone to use while in Europe I'd suggest looking at a newer model. This clunky brick works more like a phone from 2006 than 2016 which ultimately just leaves you banging your head against a wall. I purchased this phone at around $80 USD. I would have been better served to 1. buy a more expensive GSM unlocked phone that works more like a 2016 smartphone should. Or 2. buy a GSM unlocked mobile hotspot and simply tether my US based phone in Europe.",0.0

I don't think it would have worked with a USA SIM.Apart from that - the phone arrived super fast and was in perfect new condition and state.

80914,"ASUS ZenFone 2 Laser Unlocked Smartphone, 3GB RAM, 32GB Storage",ASUS Computers,229.0,5,"It feels responsive and I'm pretty happy with the Asus android distribution (having used Samsung, HTC, and Cyanogenmod, I really think ASUS did a good job). The processor isn't super fancy (like the 4GB zenfone 2) but it feels snappy and really we're getting to the point where cellphone processors are all pretty fast, I mean it has 8 cores). 3 Gigs of memory is quite a bit for a phone right now and seems to be plenty. It gets regular security and stability updates (still no Marshmallow yet, but should be soon).The screen is nice and crisp and large if rather dim in sunlight, it's still usable even then.The ""laser"" is more than a gimmic, I actually have a ""regular 4GB ram"" version of the Zenfone 2, and I compared the cameras holding both at the same time. In a dim room the regular one will be way out of focus for 1-2 seconds while the Laser focused almost immediately and stayed focused properly. That said the camera is still noticeably not as good as a Samsung Galaxy S6. Zenfone 2 Laser is not as crisp, doesn't focus as fast or shoot as fast, and focuses less reliably. Still the laser is a welcome addition, and for a cheap phone with no Optical Image Stabilization it's really not bad. Comparing side-by-side with a Galaxy S6 the only obvious disadvantage is the camera, comparing side by side with a Note 5 the screen isn't so bright and vibrant and it doesn't have the cool stylus. Still, you're saving probably close to 4-5 hundred bucks, and staying out of the serfdom of AT&T.",0.0

305490,"Samsung Focus I917 Unlocked Phone with Windows 7 OS, 5 MP Camera, and Wi-Fi--No Warranty (Black)",Samsung,29.99,5,"I am very satisfied with this phone. The only thing that could be better would be the availibility of phone settings. I think this is a limitation of the Windows Phone 7 O.S. On the one hand, since there are few settings, it is easy to set up. On the other hand, since there are few settings, you can not pick and choose when to use your data plan versus your WIFI during a specific action. It is on or off for WIFI, DATA, BLUETOOTH, AIRPLANE MODE. (My old Nokia had the ability to ask which network to use for every connection, which I liked.)While it defaults to WIFI when WIFI is present, it turns off WIFI in sleep mode to conserve battery life. I was kind of shocked to find that I used up 10 MB one night while I was asleep. A quick search finds this as a common complaint.I am on AT&T's Pay-As-You-Go plan, 10 cents per minute and I prepay for data, $5 for 10MB, $10 for 100MB, and $25 for 500MB. What I do is to pay $5.00 per month for the data plan, which rolls over my available data. This works out to about $100 every 6 months or so.There were no problems whatsover getting this phone up and running. It connects nicely with Microsoft's Skydrive. You can enter all of your contacts and calendar entries in Hotmail, and it syncs nicely with your phone, to give you a constant backup.Nothing bad to say, it looks great, there are plenty of apps available, and overall, it's a winner.Edit: There is one thing I'm not used to.

The screen was acting like it was possessed or a chipmunk on rd caffeine. It kept going to comments or my messages or previous pages on the Facebook app and it even did it on the Safari app when I decided to just use Facebook on that. Still acted up. I was really looking forward to trying out Apple but I'm really disappointed. Even with that 9.0.2 update or whatever it is, it's still doing it. The phone itself is great but that touchscreen thing, REALLY needs to be fixed. As well as on their future models. The only other positive thing I can say is that it finally showed my music than my previous phone did (not an iPhone). It would show less than half of it even though it was all right on the micro SD card I had in it.I will try Apple again someday when it gets better hopefully.

It doesn't have a lot of storage, but a $20 SD card can fix that. For $100 I'd say this phone is amazing. It's actually the same size as an IPhone 6 and the screen can get very bright. The volume is very loud though, even on the lowest, it's loud. I didn't prefer the original way that the phone came so I installed an app launcher and a new keyboard app. I've had this phone for a few months now, and it had been very fast, however, it has slowed significantly since then. This could be either from having the phone or the memory, I am not sure. But I love this phone. A problem, though, is that you can't get any personalized cases because this phone is so uncommon. The camera is great, I've taken some really great pictures. Front Flash is available and it's great on snapchat! I mean, this phone is probably better than the newest android phones, and more than half of the price. I would definitely recommend' this as a first phone, or a second or 13th phone!

I get the phone, overall it was in good condition. It had one little ding on the bottom right nothing too noticeable. After using it for about 2 days I noticed the battery life was absolutely dreadful. Luckily, the firmware was on 9.3.3 so it could be jailbroken. I jailbroke the iPhone I downloaded a tweak to give me information about my battery life it's at ~40-60% capacity it likes to jump around, it had over 800 charges. The iPhone was used a lot I could tell. So I am going to order an external battery and take apart the phone. Now if anyone else has a bad battery and they need to switch it out I recommend you go with extreme caution. If you're not comfortable with doing it then I highly recommend you don't do it. If you can pay apple their fee (which I think is roughly $100) then I would do that. However, I don't really feel apple should get $100 for a battery you can pick up for $20. But again I am fairly comfortable with taking apart my phone. Overall I am happy about the phone I will update later once I order the battery and get it put in.",0.0

Ordered this phone and it got here a day earlier than expected, works fine with my Net 10 plan, only thing was I had to add the APN for data... The earphones are hard plastic so they get uncomfortable after a while, but it charges extremely fast, battery lasted me 4 days without using data or wifi and generally at max brightness in San Francisco. For an 8 megapixel camera, it takes some really good pictures. The main complaint I have is with the case it comes with. My family all has BLU phones, and all the 6 we've bought before had soft rubber cases that were fairly protective. This phone case has hard plastic edges, and because of this after taking the case off and putting it on about 4 times (I couldn't decide whether I liked the feel of the case or not) the bottom right corner cracked and I thought it would break off. I thought it would just crack more and more from there but it seems that it only cracked due to the fact that I live in a extremely dry area and it was brittle. I dropped it hundreds of times in San Francisco and the case protected it extremely well, with no more cracks. The screen hasn't even scratched yet even though it landed face-down in the street. I'm very impressed with the phone and it's durability, and it performs far better than I had expected. The case issue seems to have been a circumstantial issue, so I wouldn't worry about it.",1.0

305744,Samsung G850F Galaxy Alpha Factory Unlocked Cell Phone - Unlocked (Charcoal Black),Samsung,622.9,5,"Here's a quick review of the international Samsung Galaxy Alpha.Before I start, I'd like to mention I have the AT&T version of the Samsung Galaxy S 5, and I also have the AT&T version of the Galaxy Alpha. I compared all three of them.Build Quality:The Galaxy Alpha in general is a beautiful phone. I love the size and how thin it is. The metal frame looks great, but it also feels very solid in my hand. My Galaxy S5 seems to creak every time I hold it. The Alpha's build quality it superb compared to the S5.It's not water resistant, however, I don't mind. I prefer the slim design and I am willing to give up water proofing to have it. Also, it's nice not to have to deal with the USB cover and the annoying water resistant warnings Samsung overlays every time you reboot the phone or unplug the USB cable.Display:My honest opinion is the Galaxy S5 has a superior display. That being said, the 720p display of the Alpha is top notch. The colors are accurate, (in photo mode), viewing angles are great, brightness is adequate, and you get the familiar benefits of it being OLED. I would like to mention that you can see the negative side effects of the diamond pentile matrix if you look at text very close up. From a normal viewing distance, the display looks fine. I've read a couple reviews that said the display had a bluish tint to it. Comparing it side by side to my Galaxy S5 the whites looked spot on! I would like to note, the alpha has slightly more color shifting when you view it from off angles. In fact, the display DOES appear more bluish at an off angle than the S5 does. However normal viewing angles it looks great. Update: I took a closer look at my two Alphas side by side. The international Alpha does indeed have a slightly cooler shade of white than the AT&T model. I'm not sure if they were purposely calibrated differently, or it's just a manufacturing thing. The AT&T model has a more accurate white, although I think both models look great!Performance:The international Galaxy Alpha and AT&T Galaxy Alpha do have some differences when it comes to performance. I noticed this immediately when comparing the AT&T Alpha to the S5. The AT&T model was just as quick in general launching apps and performing basic tasks, however it seems like the AT&T Alpha has trouble handling scrolling as well as the S5 or the international Alpha (G850F) I first noticed it when I applied the phase beam live wallpaper. Scrolling on the AT&T Alpha become jittery and frames started being dropped. On the S5 and International Alpha, it was buttery smooth. I also noticed this issue in other menus, Facebook, and scrolling webpages. The S5 and international Alpha just performed better. This is strange, because the AT&T Alpha and S5 have the same Snapdragon 801 CPU. My guess is either its somehow being down clocked to achieve similar battery life results at the international Alpha, or the AT&T Alpha's software isn't optimized for the best performance. It's could also be the result of all the AT&T bloatware and junk they've added to US version. Either way, the international (G850F) is the way to go, and it performs just at fast as the Galaxy S5.Camera:Love the camera! If you loved the S5 camera, then you will love the Alpha's camera. Essentially its the same great camera minus a few megapixels. It still takes excellent quality photos, and the focus is lighting fast! The front camera is on par with the S5 also.Battery life:The AT&T and international Alpha appear to have similar battery life. Once the batteries get broken in and have a few charges on them, I haven't had a problem getting through the day with them. Honestly, the S5 will outlast the Alpha in terms of endurance, but the Alpha will most likely get you through a full day before it needs to be charged. Update: after using the ALPHA for a while now, my average battery life seems to be very good. I'm a mid to heavy user, but I can take my ALPHA off the charger at 7am and at about midnight it will be at 10-15% battery remaining. Not Bad!Conclusion:The Galaxy Alpha it a great phone! It does sacrifice a few things that make the Galaxy S5 so great, but nothing I'm not willing to live without. It feels great in the hand, works great with one hand, and it is the best looking phone Samsung has ever made. The performance matches what you would expect from the S5, and the battery life is respectable. I'm pretty happy with the Alpha. I do recommend buying the international version as opposed to the AT&T version as the AT&T version seems to have some general performance issues. (Just a note: The G850F has dark Touchwiz menus that play nicely with the OLED screen. The AT&T version has ugly blinding white menus. Also, the G850 allows dynamic manual adjustment of the auto brightness settings if its set. You can make it slightly dimmer or brighter without taking out of auto mode. Also! The G850F is free of carrier bloat and unlocked. ++)",58.0

Unlocked - Black - 16GB - U.S. Warranty,Motorola,249.0,5,"I owe Amazon an apology for returning two of these phones upon the advice of ""techs?"" at the ATT Corporate store. When I got the first phone, I noticed that after turning it on, my SIM card would just disappear after exactly one hour. A reboot would bring the card back and it would disappear again after one hour exactly. The ATT store gave me a brand new SIM card and it did the same thing as the old card. Also the two cards I tried worked perfectly in my MOTO E which I was replacing. The aforementioned techs said that the card reader on the phone was defective, so I asked for a replacement.Amazon immediately sent me a replacement and the same problem was present. After one hour exactly the SIM card which was working in my MOTO E disappeared. I gave up and returned the second phone. I purchased the same phone from another online retailer thinking Amazon got a bad batch. The third phone did the same thing as the first two.I took the problem to Motorola and after no help at the lower level, they gave me the number of a Level 3 tech, the really smart people. He told me that the ATT tower software was kicking me off their network because I had an unlocked phone. He told me to go back to the corporate store and have them put my SIM card in an ATT branded phone until it was recognized, which took about three minutes. Then I put the card back in my unlocked Moto G and it has been solid for two weeks. The MOTO tech said ATT software doesn't play nice with unlocked phones, but this method would fix it.Anyway, I really like this phone and was determined to get it working. My wife likes it so much that I ordered another one from Amazon for her. It has amazing storage capacity and a kick butt 16MP camera. There is as much bang to the buck with this phone as those costing twice as much. I highly recommend this phone and if anyone should have the SIM card problem, the fix is simple.",21.0

231418,LG Nexus 5X Unlocked Smartphone - Mint 32GB (U.S. Warranty),LG,578.0,2,"Disclaimer: this review is mostly about the widespread bootloop issue, and some comments about the quality of the phone in general.I - Marshmallow had performance issues. Nougat made it great.I bought this phone in December 2015. On the first weeks, this phone was plagued by weird performance issues: slowdowns, quick freezes and just mediocre performance that constantly required rebooting in order to regain the smoothness it should have: being a Nexus 5 (not 5X) owner myself, I knew this one couldn't possibly be so inferior to its predecessor. Recently, the Nougat update finally turned it into the perfect phone for me, and so I was satisfied.II - Soon after, LG Bootloops appeared, rendering phone unusable.This week, I was yet another person hit by the infamous LG bootloop defect. If you don't know already, I sincerely recommend you inform yourself about it before buying this phone. Many LG models—and most of the expensive ones, 5X, G3, G4 etc. included—are plagued by some sort of these defects.As far as I know (I'm not into the technical details), there is a hardware defect on this model regarding the flash memory chip, a problem at the project level. For what I've heard, LG is issuing full refunds for those who are eligible for warranty in US. For those outside United States, or that bought the phone while in US, you are probably better giving it to a recycling center or selling it for parts, I'd guess.III - What to do?Nothing. In my particular case, and many other for what I've seen on XDA and other sites, there is no way to recover as this appears to be due to low quality of the hardware. Even trying to flash images through specialized software (with TOT images) is not possible, as the firmware download software on the phone will freeze, just like the regular boot system.IV - Alternatives and comments about other aspects of the phone.Still, that loses your time, gives you a headache and a surprise you didn't prepare yourself for, forces you to buy a new phone (if you live outside US, like I do, sorry), perhaps a larger 6P or a very expensive Pixel.Shame, because besides being a Nexus and having plenty of potential, it also has a wonderful camera that can truly take excellent pictures, especially if you know what you're doing. I'm including some samples on this review, just remember that this is a small sample that does not make justice to the full, pixel by pixel originals. Panoramas and photo spheres also come much better than the ones in my old Nexus 5 ever did. Other than that, I don't need to tell you because if you're looking for a Nexus 5X you already know what to expect and you made your homework by now.That said, this the summary of my review:- Running Marshmallow: 3 or 4 stars out of five, because of sudden performance issues.- Running Nougat: 5 stars. No complains.- Widespread bootloops and possible project defect less than a year after *release*: 2 stars because it was very good with Nougat.V - Avoiding LG phones.On a sidenote, my Nexus 5 also failed due to a hardware defect: the power button issue, which also gives you bootloops, rendering your phone unusable after quite a few months depending on the usage profile. Because of that, 2 disappointments out of 2, and considering the widespread issues with other LG models, I'm quite sure it will be a long, long time before I buy any LG phone ever again. I have many old phones (an old GNex running Marshmallow, to name one…) that I use for testing and I don't remember suffering from things like this in any of them.",0.0

The mobile is awesome. Features like blackberry hub, qwerty key pad, camera,calender,document reader etc are excellent. The only thing troubles is the voice control application. Unlike IPHONE, the voice control is not a matured application in BB Q10.It still needs lot of improvement for Blackberry 10 OS. For me, when ever I start listening music using the headphones/headset, the voice control application automatically opens and because of this music will be stopped. Unless you close the voice control app, the music will not start. Also tested the voice control app to send text message, or phone calls or email, whatever I say orally, the app is not recognizing the voice so the app sucks in this scenario.Could some one please tell me the way to disable the voice control app when listening music.

Unlocked - White - 16GB - U.S. Warranty,Motorola,249.0,5,"Ok so I've had this Moto G4 Plus (64GB storage with 4GB RAM) for 24 hours, and so this Isn't going to be a extensive review, just some things I've noticed...First of all, the build and feel of the phone is very good, not super premium like some $600 + phones, but its still very good.the fit is tight and uniform, no gaps around the screen or back cover or anything. the back cover snaps on and off without problems. the phone looks to be very well made.The android system takes up almost 10GB of storage, leaving the user with about 54.5 GB.CPU-Z shows there is 3643 MB of RAMThe buttons for power and volume feel great, make a nice little clicky feel when you push them, and the power button is textured for an easy way to feel the difference between them.the finger print scanner, is very useful, (although it doesn't serve as a button for anything) it wakes the phone up and unlocks it super fast.I would estimate about 1/4 of a second or faster. So far finger print scanner is great, way better than i expected.The screen looks great, full HD 1080P, colors have a warm look to them , the whites are not as blue looking as my Samsung phones screen.IT is a full 5.5 inch display, and yes the buttons are on screen, But can go away in certain apps, to give you the full screen to use, like when watching videos for instance.the sound is very good, although it only has one front facing speaker at the top. it is loud and clear.Call quality has been excellent, and when calling an iphone 6, about two or three feet away, with both phones on speaker. the Moto G4 Plus had no signs of feedback, or echoing, indicating it does an excellent job of noise cancellation. the iphone 6 however sounded like a horror movie.The UI (user interface) is slick and basic android. fast and responsive. the Moto gestures work well as far as the double twist for camera, and the double chop for flashlight. I have not tested the others yet.Supposedly this phone is Water and dust resistant, but i will not be testing that, for obvious reasons.The camera seems to be great so far, low light photos look pretty good, and there is even a pro mode that lets you tweak all the aspects of the camera. if you hold down the shoot button, it takes photos in rapid succession, pretty cool feature.This phone also lets you record slow motion videos which is fun.Some of the cons of this phone i can think of, are:No NFC, not a big deal to me personally, because I never plan on using android pay anytime soon at least, and I never bump my phone to share stuff with other people. I've had NFC on past phones for years, and never used it, except to try it out to see if it worked.No Magnetometer / Compass. I'm not sure of the full implications of not having a compass are, but GPS and navigation still work, because they rely on the GPS sensors, this phone also uses GLONASS, which is just the Russian version of the United states GPS system, twice as many satellites, means twice the reliability, and more accurate and faster positioning.Since there is no Compass, google sky map will not work correctly, which is big bummer for me.ON THE OVER HEATING ISSUE:I live in south Texas, and tested this phone outside with the camera app, taking dozens of photos and using CPU-Z i never noticed temps over 55 C on any of the sensors, most were about 50 C or below. also the camera app never started lagging and stuttering.I will update this review if anything changes, and after a month or two when i have spent more time with the phone.EDIT: after using this phone for 4 days now. I bumped it from a 4 to a 5 star. The battery life is very good. And easily last all day. In fact I've had the phone with me at work now since 7 am this morning, using it off and on pretty often. It is now 2:30 pm and I still have 70% left. Pretty impressive.The screen looks great in full sun with full brightness setting, no problems at all.The more I use this phone the more I like it.",524.0

I do like the ASUS ZenFone 2 Laser ZE551KL overall but the Wireless N failed to meet my expectation. Asus describes the Zenfone ZE511KL ""as fast as it is buttery smooth"" but they do not tell you it is single antennae 2.4GHz restricted to up to 75Mbps only. I opened a complaint with Asus support and they offered an RMA exchange but that would not resolve the issue as that is a limitation of the design.Several people responded to my original post saying that 72Mbps Wireless N is really fast... Please take a look at these routers and get an education on what Wireless N really can do. And before anyone complains, I am not comparing this phone to a router - just referencing Wireless N speed capabilities. (Note that these are Wireless N routers and not the even higher speed Wireless AC). These are dual-band Wireless N routers ""Delivering both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz concurrent bands up to 450 Mbps and 450 Mbps respectively"". Yes, you read it right - up to 450Mbps on the 2.4GHz band alone. While I do not expect the Zenfone to give me that 900Mbps, or even the 450 that 2.4GHz N and many phones do support, I did expect better than 72 from Asus based on their reputation as a leader in wireless networking plus the advertising. Router references for up to 900Mbps on supported Wireless N devices: ASUS RT-N66U, ASUS RT-N66R, Linksys E4200 v2, Netgear WNDR4500, D-Link DIR-857.",6.0

90416,"BlackBerry Classic Factory Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BlackBerry,149.99,5,"I've used other smartphones before and I can say BlackBerry 10 is the most complete OS I've used for my needs. One of the things that most impressed me was when I was playing Youtube on battery saving mode while attempting to record a video. The OS notified me resources were not available at the time and proceeded to stop recording the video. The multitasking aspect of the OS is handled at the kernal level (BlackBerry 10 is built off QNX/Unix technology) each application is segmented this prevents the OS from crashing and shutdowns the application of lower priority.Being able to compose documents without needing to look at the keyboard.Importance of the trackpad. I did not think I would use the trackpad often, but I realize how accurate and useful it is. First, having the ability to flip through the OS and scroll webpages without your thumb running interference with what you are viewing is nice. Second having the ability to place the cursor exactly where your want it and quickly cut and paste is a positive.I thought the phone would feel bigger based on some reviews, but the size is perfect.I appreciate the hard back button when browsing the web.Video played better than expected. The app fast tube is awesome!The camera is better than expected. It gets the job done for what I will be using it for, spontaneous pictures when I'm out and about. The video and photo editing features are solid for a smartphone.Webpages render nicely.In summary, I would of switched to blackberry a few years back but they we're behind the game. I'm glad I made the switch now considering their advancements in the OS, which I cannot say enough positive things about.I typed this review on my classic using 'word to go', after one day I really started to appreciate the keyboard. The initial few hours were slow, but I'm getting faster by the hour. For new users considering switching to a Qwerty keyboard, you should realize it will be a little slow and awkward at first but you will become comfortable with it in no time. Going forward I will use my blackberry to send the vast majority of my emails.",3.0

After a month of using it temporarily, I can say that it's a very good phone with a long battery life. You don't even need to tinker much with the settings. Its ""Smart Manager"" does a pretty good job.RAM wise, I don't know if it's for everyone. I have so many apps that I'm too lazy to uninstall so I'm already using 70% of the 1.5GB. Even then the phone is working smoothly. In my mom's case, 1.5GB is enough but I might need more than this.If I have to choose between RAM and battery life though, I'd choose battery life next time. Just bought a Moto X pure edition with 16GB, 3GB RAM but the Samsung still beat Motorola by a mile. I don't know though if it's because I upgraded the Moto to Android M. Good thing, I only paid $300 for the Moto X Pure edition (vs $250 for the Samsung J7 in Feb).Warranty-wise, I was trying to register the international J7 version on the US website but I could not find the model there. It says that if it's not a US model then I have to register on the international website. Even after several times, I wasn't able to register the phone successfully on the Phil website. I might end up trying to call them about it.headphone plug is at the bottom -- I prefer it on the top.I like the ""Outdoor"" setting so you can see the screen outside.I am not an expert but I like the graphics and sound quality.Samsung J7 is an excellent phone! I might end up with a Samsung next time.UPDATE:When I brought this home to the Philippines in April I put in a local micro-SIM card in one of the slots and it worked immediately. So far my mom has no issues with the phone. The only risk is that this phone has no warranty in both the US and the Philippines. A Samsung Service Center in the Philippines said that that they only provide warranty to locally purchased phones. They can still fix the phone of course for a price.",88.0

255463,Motorola Motofone F3 Unlocked Phone with Dual-Band GSM 850/1900--International Version with No Warranty (Black),Motorola,63.28,5,"I discovered this phone's existence online. Once again, thanks to Amazon's unparalleled customer review knowledge base, I got the skinny and knew what I was in for. I wanted a phone with a screen that was READABLE. Due to limitations in technology (LCD) and biology (my need for reading glasses), the screen of my little Nokia is only visible when cupped in my hands in a darkened theater. And even that low-budget phone has too much JUNK to wade through. (I don't care to do Internet shopping by phone, thanks though) The Motofone F3 does what a phone is supposed to do - it lets you TALK to people quickly and easily. It's Electronic Ink screen is amazing - you REALLY CAN read it in broad daylight. Why isn't any other phone using this technology?If you're interested, please do read the reviews. These phones are not marketed in the USA it seems - I guess we are collectively just too hip and sophisticated for this quaint little thing. Mine came ""unlocked"" as advertised - I just transplanted the SIM card from my old phone and I was ready to go. You have to choose your preferred language, and if you want a manual for the dozen or less functions, you can download it easily from Motorola.Some of the negative reviews are gut-busters. Did these folks even READ about the phone they were getting? Maybe it was a gift, I don't know. ""Box was opened!""? That's because they're pulling these from South America or India and unlocking them for you! ""Has a crappy interface!""? It does look like Etch a Sketch, but hey, I don't care to have all my friends' avatars on my screen. I can speed dial about 15 numbers. And you CAN send and receive text, if'n you really have to, though I don't think I ever will. (So counterintuitive... that's why God invented keyboards!) ""Phone has no color screen! / no MP3 player! / no camera!"" etc... Well, if that's what you want, you don't want this phone. I told all my higher-tech friends that I just got two ""Third World Phones"" - and my wife and I love them.Note: apparently some folks did not get ""unlocked"" phones or had other technical problems. I was lucky in that regard. (May have been a different vender.) Also make sure your phone plan uses compatible technology. Amazon has a little chart at the top of the page to help you with this too.

Since I live in Mountain View, I get free WiFi within the city from Google, so I don't have too much of a need for a data plan when I can use the built in WiFi.The camera takes great pictures at 3.2 megapixels. Video quality is good as well with a decent frame rate, but not the highest resolution (QVGA). Good enough for YouTube or Facebook.Voice quality is not the best. Also, I had to go to the UK for a case that conforms to the phone design. It also doesn't have a Qwerty keyboard input for texting. A couple small sacrifices for a smart phone without a contract, a steep price or a monthly gouging.Very happy with this phone.",59.0

In a month it got completely non-usable, to the point one can not even start it (by sliding finger on touch screen). Working with the vendor trying to get a replacement and give it another try. In light of the current experience, I can not recommend these phones to anybody, Also, Nokia stopped developing their Maemo line and actually got purchased by Microsoft. I do not expect much support coming from there... :-( F for Fail. The vendors proved to be dishonest. I returned the phone via UPS (another $18 I have to spend on that). Seller received the phone a week ago and since their only reaction was to claim they need ""1-2 business days to review the item"". They did not replaced or refunded the purchase.

I can then have more icons on a screen, a nexus look, quicker animations, and no blinkfeed. yet I keep features like ZOE.the feel is great, it makes every other phone feel cheap. It can survive a fall on it's face. my feel out of my car door face down on cement- only a small scratch on the metal speaker- glass is perfect still. the metal back is very slipper, be extra careful in dress pants.I use a fancy dualpro case now, it makes it much more grippy..great sound quality. sometimes a little too loud. headphones were included, they sound good, not as good as my sony's though.This phone has the best screen I've ever seen. ever. Full HD in a super small space. it's good in dark and bright light too.call quality is fine, I haven't had dropped calls.IR blaster is pretty cool. button placement is okay, it takes a little getting used to.Camera images are low resolution, they can't really be zoomed in on, but they look good and it works okay in low light. auto focus is a little intense, it tries a bit too hard with focal length and exposure.the task manager takes a bit of getting used to, it's fine though and pretty quick.Hopefully the 4.4 firmware update will come soon.Really, any software con can be fixed with 3rd party apps.slippery back and low pixel camera are my only cons with this phone- it's fantastic.",0.0

Each LG i believe beats out the other phones in its manufacturing year. the internet speed is one of the best video quality is good, and productivity apps are great. speakers are very good, but not great. light weight but very durable. this phone is near perfect especially whe n you consider the price point. it absolutely blows my mind this isn't apples direct competitor. i would take this over any Samsung, and over any apple products although i get the people who like iphones. absolutely recommend this phone to anyone looking for a good android, oh by the way did i mention, battery is removable and micro sd slot is available. phones a perfect 10 for me",0.0

I've been an exclusive Nokia user for 10 years now so maybe its time for a change.i've loved this phone even before i got it. it looks cool, it feels good in your hand, its comfortable to type on and the touch screen works. the C6 is built solid; its taken quit a few falls and kept on ticking (which is probably why its not working now). there are not many options of covers for the C6 and the silicone covers which are good for falls, interfere with the proximity sensors some times. the camera is good (better in sunlight). video is ok but not the best. i usually power up every 3 days. the processor/apps can slow down at times but its not a big issue. i have issues downloading apps from OVI because of my location (the caribbean).the best thing about Nokia phone is the Nokia Suit. i have hundreds of contacts and media but i can easily move my content from 1 phone to another using this suit. this is one of the reasons i've been with Nokia this long... that and the solid build of the phones.

These apps are something my son would never use. It really takes away the hold ideal of having an unlocked phone. If my son didn't really need a phone right now I would probably send it back. Its kind of thick for its size but that's because of the battery that's being used. I did expect that as a needed measure. I have used it to charge another phone yet, so cannot comment on that feature.Pros: The phone looks good in person. So far it seems to load apps and surf the web okay.

308760,"Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679",Samsung,119.99,5,"I am so amazed by this phone!! I seriously can't imagine someone trying this phone, looking at the price, and going on to buy some other phone that either costs 2x as much, or signing a contract!You would think they'd cheap out on this phone to make the higher price phones look better, but the only defects of this phone are expected, the basic camera (flash included) and the rear speaker (should be two front facing).Otherwise the standout feature is the crisp, beautiful screen. It is made of a very resistant material that reveals a pristine brightness. Not a single miniscule scratch after a month of use.This comes with the newest version of Android for phones, Gingerbread 2.3.5(though ICS was recently released for the flagship Samsung Galaxy Nexus).This phone becomes even better when you root it and remove some of the unnecessary T-Mobile applications, and further tweak it. There are about 5 icons that are pretty useless, but can't be removed normally. Perhaps they are included to reduce the cost.This actually works better than most GPS devices out there. Just buy a windshield or similar mount and take full advantage. This has been my experience:1. Waze - Community driven navigation that gets better when more and more people use it, reporting traffic, and new roads. This can really help you find better routes on your commute. The drawback is that it's harder find newer places in its directory.2. Google Nav - everything you can find in Google Maps, is navigable here. Complete with Google's satellite imagery. Very polished and includes traffic reports.3. TeleNav GPS - comes with the phone, and is the closest to a traditional GPS device. The free version works quite well, without ads or distractions. You must pay a monthly fee for additional features.Here is my experience with watching streaming video:1. Netflix - Works perfectly.2. Hulu Plus - Does not work yet. Says the content is not yet available for this device.3. T-Mobile TV - Included app works really well, but the best content requires subscription. Even has LiveTV!4. Amazon Video - Officially it is only for the Kindle Fire, but I got it working quite well by tricking the program. Only works on Wi-Fi.5. Crackle - The low quality you expect, but it works6. Qik - Records and uploads video instantlyGames:All Angry Bird Games work perfectly smooth, Cut The Rope a total delight, Fruit Ninja fun as always, Where's My Water is a bit tricky on this size screen, and I haven't tried much other popular games as these are enough to entertain.Reading:Kindle, Nook, Zinio, and Google Books appear nice and clear.Music:The built-in speaker is very loud, but not very clear for dynamic music. For optimal enjoyment and respect for those around you, use headphones.VOIP:Google Voice works well, and you can use it to make and receive calls (4G up to 5GB and 100min plan is perfect for $30). Google Voicemail is incompatible with prepaid plans. Skype works well and video chat is acceptable. MobileVOIP works well.So why consider a different phone? Well the processor is more than capable if you're conscious that it's a single core, and has its limits. So far, every program that I could want on a phone works well. Things start to slow down with several programs that use data service. The built-in camera won't replace your standard digital camera, but is useful for day to day capture. But why pay hundreds more for a phone that can't out do a good basic camera?Additional features: use tethering to make it work as a 4G modem to share the internet connection via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth devices, listen to internet radio, watch movie files, use as LED flashlight with a program, use as an alarm clock, view Facebook and Twitter, scan barcodes and research products, and do everything else that you can do with Android apps.Plan to keep the phone plugged in to a car charger if using for navigation, use a battery managing program, and the battery should last the day. A charger for the office (secondary location) would be advisable for heavier use, especially tethering.This phone may be unlockable by calling T-Mobile after 3 month of use, or you can pay an unlocking website to use it with another provider.",1.0

There's not much inside the box, just the charger usb cord, small touchpen, micro sd chip/adapter combo and battery. (In the original order it had a docking charger and hip carrying pouch) Also should note that there was a generic replacement battery instead of the SAMSUNG one.Battery in, Excitement on - Or so I thought, I quickly learned that I have to keep the charger nearby. Either from this being a faulty battery or just the low quality of the generic replacement. It never seems to fully charge to 100, and if it does it drops back down to 90-94 within a matter of 10 mins of use. Even with all the apps cut completely off, no data or voice being used it cut off from 20% down to 0 during the period of 1 hour. Really disappointing. I would recommend purchasing an extended battery (but you do have to get the extended case as well which makes the phone bulky)As for the actual usage. I'm switching over from the iphone so I'm enjoying the new swipe type texting/keyboard. Unfortunately with these I find that I'm fat fingering it more the iphone. The feel of the keyboard touch is so smooth that you don't really sense the actual keys (I guess it's something I'll have to get used to). Also the autocorrect, doesn't seem to be correcting as it should.I've also noticed some lag (during screen transitions, swyping while using whatsapp, and the back out process when you're in a app)Music/Media - Changing/adding music was a breeze, adding pics to the external sd card was simple and it picked up everything and loaded it to the media gallery already in folders (if you have personal pics you DEFINITELY want to reorganize it - also download safe gallery free to password protect some folders/pics)VPN/Tethering/Hotspot - now by default this DID NOT WORK. I was highly upset at first and did a bunch of reading to see how to enable (yes I know the basic steps but it kept saying ""not a valid sim"") So I finally downloaded hotspot toggle widget and it activated it for me. I'm guessing it was either a software malfunction or security issue which was stopping me from turning it on/off through the regular interface.Pictures - look amazing and so does video... Absolutely no complaints thereCellular network - I went with T-mobile since they have the best package here and 4G... Well let's just say T-mobile sucks in a lot of areas but it's great to be able to leverage that hotspot when you're in a 4G area. Also, I had no trouble switching over (since it's a ATT unlocked device). The SIM was popped in, and it registered on their network in about 2 hours.Screen - I constantly worry when I'm going to crack it when it's in my pocket, but it seems pretty sturdy. I've dropped it a few times (it's slippery due to its nice finish). Background light is great indoors but once you get outside, it's all over. This is a downside of most phones but not all!Volume/Ringer - Felt the need to add that it's really not that loud, nor does it vibrate that hard (even after maximizing all settings) Will probably create and amplify my own ringtones for a decent noticeable ringer.I would have liked to see a hdmi output on this one and possibly a slot for the touchpen, louder volume, outdoor contrast and less bloatware (that'll drain the crap out of your battery as well - I disabled 7 apps that came with the phone and haven't needed or noticed them since)",22.0

271456,"Nokia Lumia 830 GSM Smartphone, Black - AT&T - No Warranty",Nokia,145.0,5,"Switching from iPhone it was definitely a little weird at the beginning and took some time to get used to (even as a Surface tablet user) but after a few weeks with the Lumia I just love it more. Definite highlights for me are the camera (took so many good vacation pictures that you would think I had a professional camera with me, yeah the camera is that good in my opinion), the Here drive + offline navigation (takes quite a lot of battery but definitely saved me a few times from getting lost while on vacation and not having internet), the screen (very good resolution and sensitive touch screen, reacts so much better than my old iPhone) and the camera (oh yeah the camera's so good it deserves to be mentioned twice. As someone that doesn't have a real camera and takes all picture with the phone I'm just baffled that I can take pictures with that quality with my phone now). Known flaw is the windows app store, but I could find all the important apps for me, which are not a lot because I really just use my phone for text, calls, the occasional google search or email and then of course for music and as a camera. All that works great and with a 64 GB SD card there is enough storage for all my music and pictures. I have a Surface tablet for work and a Kindle for reading so I don't expect my phone to do what my tablet can or have the battery time from my kindle, I just expect it to work and that's what it does and it does it smooth and without any problems. Battery lasts 2 days with regular use (even 3 with less use), which I consider as being remarkable for a phone with all the features that the Lumia has. I wanted a good and fast phone for not too much money with a very good camera and that is exactly what I got and I really do love it.",1.0

Very fast, works well on AT&T, operating system is snappy and intuitive - I'm more a fan of Windows Phone but Sony's version of Android Lollipop is solid. Battery life is good and better than phones I've had in the past - I do use fairly power-intensive apps though and need to charge it every 36 hours or so. Screen is bright and clear. The build quality feel of the phone is high. Audio quality is great on headphones, passable on speaker / phone calls, it could improve in this area. I'm glad it has front facing speakers, though haven't utilized them a great deal. One thing, I cracked the back glass within days because I thought I wouldn't need a case - I was wrong, just a small impact cracked it while it was inside my pocket. I recommend a TUDIA slim line case which also works great with a DEFF magnetic charger, Magnetic charging is awesome by the way, the next best thing to wireless, it puts less strain on the USB port and covers so probably helps it maintain waterproof status. I haven't dared take the phone for a plunge yet but after a few months I might risk it!",

(Model#: L530 GOLD)",Posh Mobile,152.99,5," This is a great phone! Phone looks and feels good to hold and use. My favorite things about this phone is that for not a lot of money you're getting a very good phone. I'm picky about my phones and this checks everyone of my box. it's affordable. It has a great 720 display with great viewing angles. It has just enough ram and storage (2GB and 16GB) for my needs and more. It has LTE bands. It has 2 great 13 MP cameras with Electronic Image Stabilization. It has a fingerprint scanner. Those last 2 points are just the cherry on the cake. I'm very impressed that you're getting so much phone for not a little money. There are other phones that come with half of the specs that this phone has for the same price. Posh Mobile really put out a good phone this time.My 3 favorite things about this phone is the front and back 13 MP cameras and that it comes with a fingerprint reader. They are really really nice for what you're paying. The phone is stock android so the camera app. The camera shines when you get a different app that can really maximize the use of the cameras. Pictures are very detailed with good color saturation. Video recording caps out at 1080 at 30 frames per second on the back camera and 480P on the front camera. Both look great and if you need a phone with video chatting capabilities than this phone is for you. Selfie lovers will love this camera. I like that it comes with a fingerprint reader. It works very well and no one will get into your phone. You don't have to hit the power button most times. I find that I just put my hand in the pocket and find the fingerprint reader and by the time I put it up to my face the phone is unlocked and ready to go when I am. Finally my last favorite thing about this phone is the battery life. It has a lower powered processor and 720P display that makes battery life last most of the day. I found that I didn't have to top off until later in the day with moderate use. Playing games and watching videos and GPS are normal parts of my day and this kept up with me just fine.The phone I think is a great value but there are some things you should know. The only accessories you can get are what comes in the box. Charging cable, plastic case that hides how good looking this phone is, and a plastic screen protector. I searched and searched but there isn't anything for this phone. I had to be comfortable with using this phone naked. It attracts a lot of fingerprints because of how glossy it is. I really wish I could get some accessories for this phone. The speaker is single firing from the bottom of the phone. It's loud but not the greatest and is easily covered up by holding it in landscape. It's not a deal breaker at all but something that should be pointed out.I also haven't gotten any updates for this phone yet. It could use a few tweaks to make it that much better but we shall see what's in store for this phone. I don't know if it'll get Android 6.0 but if it does than this phone will become an absolute must buy.",13.0

Includes 16GB microSD card & updated firmware to Jelly Bean 4.1.2 :-). What more you need!!!? & I paid $187 for it (on 29 Jan, 2014). BUT, I received this phone today (10th Feb)!!! Shipping was terrible. It supposed to be delivered on 6th Feb, but... :-|. I was very angry!!! but when I opened the box... wow! it was an awesome experience!!! I definitely recommend this phone!!!Update (24 Feb, 2014): Still flawless performance after 24 days of power usage. You just can not ask anything more on 'performance' department. I could not utilize 2GB RAM, it is more than enough. Quad core CPU is super fast. I see many users complaining about battery life. Well 2100mAH is not enough for a android device like Optimus G to run 24 hours on moderate use. However, you can get that much of battery life by turning on 'Eco Mode' from setting menu. And about camera performance, it is doing pretty well. Images are fairly sharp enough, though the front facing camera is not that sharp. But you have to consider its price. In this price, this phone is the best phone ever!!! I still, highly recommend this phone.Update (06 Oct, 2014): Bought another one for my sister. She is very happy with this phone. An EXCELLENT piece of hardware, released on December, 2012! Don't even think about the performance, its superb because of a very capable Qualcomm CPU with Adreno 320 GPU, coupled with 2GB of RAM, which still a standard amount of RAM. Only grape is the battery life. Its average. I'm rocking android version 4.4.4 (CyanogenMod 11). So, I'm getting the latest version of android through Cyanogen (they are still supporting the device), and my hardware is good too. What else I need?",17.0

For the most part I was enjoying the phone and its easy interface to my google accounts. My first frustration was the voicemail. Visual voicemail is something you expect as a basic service on your phone - you miss a call, they leave a voicemail, your phone notifies you of a new voicemail. That is not native on the 5x. I had to set up a google voice account but it doesn't always update real time so I had to set it to text me when I have a new voicemail so I'd know I had to go check google voice.But my main reason for the poor review is that the fingerprint scanner hardware quit working in early June. I did a factory reset followed by a hard reset and it started working again but only for a few days. So LG gave me a return authorization for a warranty repair and they received it at the repair facility on 6/21/16. They haven't even started working on as of today 7/6/16.

I choose it because of it's fairly large screen size, light weight, and versatility applications. So far I'm not disappointed (used it for almost two weeks), performs greatly (no hiccups and switches apps very smoothly). I have even upgraded it the Jelly bean android 4.1.2 version with ease, and it's still working greatly. I only followed the instructions from Samsung support page to the letter!Over all great phone, especially for those who are not ready for Galaxy s3 or 4 yet. This will more than give you what you need- it's all a matter of application! Though I haven't used any of those I'm wondering if there will be much difference in functions. The battery is the problem so far- runs down quickly so that you're constantly charging. Maybe because I use it a lot, and run many applications on it!",6.0

My Galaxy S4's both microphone and speaker stopped functioning in 3 months after I bought it (which apparently was a very frequent failure of S4), and after 1.5 year of usage one day the phone started to getting into a bootloop and freezing in 1 minute everytime I would turn it on. I sent it to repair and I had to pay for Samsung to fix it since warranty was already over. So for Samsung it is normal that your phone becomes useless in less than 1.5 year you buy it.After 1.5 years with Samsung galaxy S4, I wanted to try the Galaxy S5 and hence I bought this phone. In 7 months my phone stopped functioning again, and again the problem was software failure. I called the repair center, asked them if they can retrieve the photos first before fixing it, and they said they would delete everything as a policy. So I went to a repair shop in New York and asked them to reciver my photos. Next I sent my phone to Samsung. Now Samsung is rejecting to repair the phone claiming that a different O/S is installed and hence the phone is out of warranty. They are not taking any responsibility on the fact that if there is a different O/S installed in the phone that is because their phone stopped functioning within months of purchasing it again (just as my Galaxy S4 experience). The person from the customer service that I talked also repeated himself life a robot saying that the phone is out of warranty, and he did not make any comments on the fact that they should take responsibility on the fact that the phone stopped functioning at the first place. Low quality products, low quality customer service summarizes Samsung, so you should all stay away from their products.",0.0

Three days of owing this phone, it stopped working as it should. Had missed calls because the phone just froze, and i wasnt aware until i got an iMsg on my iPad that i was MIA. Upon checking the phone, i see that i could not use the touch screen, i forced a shutdown, and after numerous attempts to force a reboit ( i held the power button for many many seconds) it did turn on after abt five tries!Now i was warned prior to looking for a new phone.Other notables:Screen reacts to daytime light in a bad way, u have to be inside to see the screen as it is a virtual mirror when outdoors.Small keypad makes for slow data entry and errorsVoice feature offsets the keypad issue above. In fact i would say its the coolest feature of the phone.Useless apps cant be hidden, like grayed out...if anyone knows how o, please leave a comnent.Not intiitive as iDevices, had to read the manual for simple tasks such as applying a pic to a contact, and swiping ( default call answering ) to answer a call. I promptly found a way to reassign the Home key to answer calls.Another cool feature is joining contacts. Allows u to EASILY join or unjoin your cobtacts as one in your contact list. If you have the same contact under diff names or from diff places like, linkedIn, FB, Google...So i am giving the phone 3 stars because i prefer substance over form. Its aesthetically pleasing though....",

2195,"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,129.0,5,"I caught this during their pre-release. At the time I was thinking about replacing my cracked screen Note 2. My phone was still functional, but it has been a couple years. Since the Note 5 should be released soon, I purchased this inexpensive phone in the interim. I wasn't expecting so much, other than it to hold me over.Pulling it out of the packaging, immediately, it felt slim and light. Almost light to the point of cheapness. That feeling has gone away since, now I appreciate how slick and light weight it is.I fired it up, the screen looks beautiful. Bright, with great color too. Turned it back off, inserted my sim card and sd card. That was a bit cumbersome compared to previous phones that I have had, but given the slim nature of the design, it may have been a necessity. After getting it all setup, and navigating around a bit, I found it pretty snappy. I downloaded my normal apps, and installed Aviate, the launcher which I have been using since beta and find very clean.If you're coming from 4.x Android or another OS, you won't have the small gripes that I have. I had installed Cyanogenmod 12.1 on my note 2 before switching to this phone and there are quite a few features I miss from that version. These are minor, and in no way have a significant negative affect on how I like this phone. The fact you can use the phone, or any app upside down is a neat idea, but in practice, your buttons are in the wrong spot, and it still feels upside down. The camera seems good, but I am no camera expert, and only take pictures from time to time.Over the past week or so, here is what I found that stands out:Good:Front facing speakersScreen quality, bright and detailedLight weight*** PRICE *** I doubt you'll find anything close in this price range, rivals $500+ phones imoBattery lifeCall quality via hand set, speaker phone and bluetoothNot so good:Not a lot of case optionsOther notes that may affect your purchase decision:Charging port position is off center, awkward, and may interfere with some cradlesPower button feels like it is in the wrong spotNon-removable battery, may be no issue, I haven't ever replaced a battery in my other phones, and I expect one to last at least a couple years which is fine to me.Bottom line for me:I was surprised how good this phone is. Initially it was supposed to be temporary, but I will keep it until I break it. Good phone, crazy awesome price! Unless you want the specific name brand, buy this, you won't be sorry.6/3/15Updated observations:When in a phone call, the screen doesn't rotate, even when just using bluetooth. This causes a small issue when I want to go from a phone call to using navigation software since I want the landscape view. As soon as the call hangs up, it rotates how it should.I had one random reset, of course this was while I was navigating downtown Seattle and needed to know my next turn.I took the time to watch video on this, and the audio is AWESOME!Battery life is definitely acceptable for me, not the best or worst. It lasts me more than all day though with moderate use.There is a feature that can be turned on that allows you to tap twice to turn on/off the screen, that does not work so well.7/7/15Ended up with a very small scratch on the screen, probably from my keys, so if you pick this up, get a screen protector.Still overall a five star purchase to me!",3.0

Every time you plug it in to charge it powers itself off and you have to power it back on. Even when you plug it into the pc to transfer photos or music it powers off.

Touchwiz is just awkward to me and I'm still trying to tell if its because I'm coming from Sense or if it really is just awkward.On an Android you have access to plenty of add ons - games entertainment etc - supplied by Samsung, Amazon and Google Play (I have no idea why someone would want an iPhone). For the S6 Edge there are Samsung apps customized for it including a bunch of apps that can run along the edge called ""Edge Specials"".

12237,Apple iPhone 4S 16GB (Black) - Verizon,Apple,224.77,1,"The bottom line is that I disliked this phone so much that I returned it! I know you're not supposed to say that about Apple products, but read on to see why I think people are largely ""drinking the Koolaid"" on the iPhone.The Bad: When I first wanted a smartphone I got a very cheap Droid, which was hard to sync between the Mac home computer I use and my Google email accounts. Eventually I got it working, but I anticipated that the almighty iPhone would be seamless right out of the box. It wasn't -- with the iPhone I had all the same troubles going back to the Google accounts that I had had with the Droid going to the Apple products the first time around. Not fun.I also didn't like that there is NO app available to back SMS text messages up to your Gmail or other email account the way there is for Android phones (SMS Backup+). In the event of a phone change, and god forbid you do not want another iProduct, you will lose all of those conversations.I couldn't organize the screens the way I wanted them.I missed having my contacts' pictures show up next to text messages and in my phone address book. (It's the little things, but still!)The ""back"" menus will probably frustrate former Droid users, as sometimes you have to use the actual butto at the bottom of the phone to go back to the Home screen, but sometimes you want the real ""back"" button on the screen which is usually (but not always) located at the top. This is counterintuitive and annoying.The Good: The camera worked well, the screen was beautiful and the sound was good. Size is great compared to the other expensive Android models which are a bit like holding an entire computer up to your head. Also, there are no rights issues with older iTunes purchases which I have yet to resolve on my new Android.The Verdict: Overall I was disappointed in the operating system I think largely because the iPhone is supposed to be the gold standard among smartphones and I had heard wonderful, glowing things from so many people who LOOOOVE their iPhones. However, naysayers come out of the woodwork once they realize that they will have a sympathetic ear in someone who isn't subscribing blindly to the iUniverse, and there are a fair number of people who prefer the Droids. To me the final factor may be how computer-savvy you are going in, and how much time you want to put into learning about your phone and all the different service providers and programs that will, in theory at least, work together to get it to do what you want it to do. If you're willing to take the time, you might eventually prefer an Android. If not, the iPhone is definitely not as simple as I thought it would be but I would still recommend it for anyone who doesn't have the technological know-how or desire to play detective in order to get things set up.I will add that when combined with trying to find the right cellular service provider (Verizon has NONEXISTANT customer service and everything requires several phone calls as well as hours on hold to get anything done, AT&T has less signal strength in my area and I couldn't get usable data to with T-Mobile through Straight Talk), buying a new phone and a smartphone in particular has been one of THE most frustrating experiences of my life. Once I get my current phone working (a Samsung Galaxy S3), I plan to keep it forever and to never, ever, ever make any changes to my ""system"" again! What an exercise in futility this has been!",3.0

I knew this phone is outdated by 2 years but here is my thought: Comparing to new mid-range phones are currently offering, this device is still a beast!* PROs and impression:- good specs- small bezels- 5.2 inches is great size, fit well in my pockets. Unlike the 5.5 inches OPO- bottom speakers- all high-end, neat features included (QuickRemote!, double tap, NFC, Miracast,...)- Great camera with optical image stabilization!- unique design with all buttons on the back*CONs and suggestion:- plastic, slippery material for the back. Get a case, I suggest Diztronic TPU.- Do NOT buy screen protector, none will fit neatly since there is a slight curve on the sides.- ugly default launcher ^_^ install new one.

For the cost, about $250 when I bought it, it's the best no contact phone out there. It has the guts of a Galaxy S5, with a very capable processor and enough internal storage to install a good number of apps and music.It differs from the S5 in a few big, notable ways. For one, it has a metal frame, which sits very comfortably in the hands and gives it a solid feeling. It's certainly looks very nice, and if you've got a desire to have a phone with a stylish design, this one definitely fits the bill.On the downside, the display isn't quite as high res, it lacks an SD card slot for expandable storage, and it has a smaller, lower capacity battery compared to the S5. Thankfully, the lower resolution display still is very sharp, and you can still play videos at 720p resolution. The display also helps the battery life out, with the phone capable of lasting a decent 12-16 hours with moderate usage. With constant usage, it'll last about 8-10 hours.",0.0

Without these functions, it lasts about three days.Windows 8 is easy and fun to use, although it has fewer applications available in their store than Android.The camera has a great quality compared to the standard camera phones.For me, a great quality of the phone is its GPS.

369794,"Samsung Galaxy S6 SM-G920i Unlocked Cellphone, 32GB, Black Sapphire,INTERNATIONAL VERSION NO WARRANTY",Samsung,479.99,5,"Initial Review 1. Build - Hardware: The build quality of S6 is top notch, if not better, then as good as the iphone. The photos in the website or in the samsung portal do not do justice to the actual look and feel of the phone. There are reviews that mention the s6 look similar to iphone 6 and I would agree to that. I moved from an S3 to S6. The S3 after 3 years of use, had become slow, but moving the same apps to S6, the apps worked seemlessly. 2. Screen: The 577 pixels per inches is pixel density results in a screen with crisp displays and super sharp and smooth images. 3. Software: The android build on the S6 has so far run smoothly for past 3 months and so has all the apps I have used so far. 4. Camera: I havent played around with the photo as much as the video. The video on this is just incredible.4K ultra-HD video. The color reproductions are like something out of Downtown Abbey.Yes, the battery life on a single charge is nothing to talk about. I get a whole days use. The upside is that the phone comes with a super charger that charges the phone to 90% within 30 minutes or so.Long time Review1-Month: We end up finding some new feature every time we use it.i. GPS navigator - We used S6 as a navigator while travelling to New York. Compare the 60's cartoon screen of an Garmin with 577 ppi screen of S6 and you willl understand why you WANT to use S6 as a navigator even if you dont need to. Google maps has an offline mode, as long as you have enough storage on your phone to download the maps of the location. The best part was that during navigation, an incoming call, would just should up as a smally rectangular bar with information about the caller and accept/decline button and at the same time, the navigation would still be displayed.ii. Finger Print unlock. Setting up is a breeze. there was a bit of apprehension whether if it will work. For one, the fingerprint unlock worked every time, the first time and again, there is a backup password (in case finger print doesnt work)6 month review:i. iphone6 and 6s have come and gone and after comparing the S6 to iphones my vote is for S6.ii. S6 continues to work without issues. The phone accidently dropped from 5 ft and there was no scratch on it - I did have a protective cover.",94.0

You need to push and hold down the release then pull off the cover using other finger's nail. I hate that3- It does not have US English.4- It's not a US version neither a European version. It's Asian version.It has all Asian languages, but no US English or European language.5- it does not pick up 4G on tmobile, just 3G.Update: I gave it first time 4 stars, now giving it only 3 stars because HTC is not supporting this phone anymore. The last software update to android 4.0.3 was back in december 2012, now the jelly bean 4.2.2 is out there but HTC says that the sensation xe is not getting it.

I bought the phone in October of 2015. It performed perfectly and I have been thrilled with the phone. In November of 2016 I contacted AT&T to have the phone unlocked. It seems there was still a balance owed on the phone. From AT&T: ""You have not completed all the payments for your device according to your AT&T Next service agreement."" So they won't unlock it.I contact the seller and I get this:""This phone was purchased over 395 days ago. We ask to be contacted within our 30 day return policy for any issues you encounter with the device. We are unable to assist you with unlocking this phone.Thank you,Kiley""Okay, I get it, I've owned the phone for a year. But do I own it or not? Why would they sell me a phone with a balance on it? One can speculate on how they acquired it or whether they cared to check to see if there was a balance on it, or whether they cared. I contacted customer service. While well intentioned, they seemed to not truly understand the problem and every email sent to me from them had a different foreign name on the signature and it seemed like the left hand didn't know what the right was doing. After I finally called and spoke to someone in person, also clearly not an English first speaker, they did send the seller a message telling them to refund me the money and a tag for returning the phone.No dice. The seller is stonewalling now. In one of the emails between myself and Amazon they offered me a one time $100 certificate so I guess I'll accept that and shut up. Still there seems to be no consequences for the seller, MyWit, selling a phone with a balance owed on it. Doesn't seem right to me. Do what you will with this info, folks.Great phone though.",0.0

I'd read the reviews, most by those who I supposed expected a $130 overtake a $700 Samsung Sx! Clearly, that was not my expectation. The first thing I did was restore it via Google and moved the SIM to this phone and used it for a few days. This is a large phone, comparable to say a Galaxy Note the screen is very nice, bright and sharp. The BLU phone comes with a more virgin android 4.4.2 operating system - to be upgraded to Lolipop before the end of the year. It's just amazing how much carriers like AT&T and T-Mobile screw up a perfectly good OS! Operationally, I could find nothing to complain about. The phone comes with a case, screen protector, ear-buds with mike, and AC charger. The battery is huge and last about 50% longer than our Galaxy phones. On top of that - it includes an FM radio. I can't tell you how many times I wished my Galaxy had this (they do in Europe btw) when I am at a ball game and the 80,000 fans are sharing the same network! Yikes. Bottom line - great phone at a great price!",11.0

I ordered one of these on and had it sent to me in the USA. Shipped it off to Mallorca, Spain and my sister took it to the prepaid sim card store and they entered the correct numbers to get it to work with their network with voice and data perfectly. It is very usable on any other network worldwide you just need to have the correct info for that network and its good to go.The only con is the battery doesn't seem to last that long although this may be due to some settings on the phone and the battery may be old, you can get a replacement Anker battery that lasts longer or even a Samsung on Amazon for under 10 bucks. You can also add memory to this phone for storage with a micro SD card. its a great deal.

(MODEL#: S240 LIGHT BLUE)",Posh Mobile,49.99,5,"Picked this little gem up in the spring when my previous Android phone of many years simply got too old to use without heavy modification. I'd been a huge fan of the small-sized HTC Aria phone and was disappointed with my phone plan's selection of gigantic and pricey ""upgrades"" for this year. A web search about the smallest smart-devices of 2016 turned up an article mentioning the Posh Micro phones, and after a bit more sleuthing around since the little guy almost seemed too good to be true I ordered one here. Have not regretted my purchase one bit and I recommend the Posh Mobile Micro phone to anybody looking for something tiny like me!Pros:- Exceptionally portable & handy. It fits in my skinny jean pockets, my small purses and my tiny hands!!- Sturdy plastic case and screen has held up exceptionally well to accidental encounters with the pavement & tile floor.- Easy to pick-up Android interface and file manager. It didn't take long to get everything set up on it like on my old phone. Has very reasonable text size settings within it so if you find the text in menus to be too small, it can be easily adjusted.- Added unexpected bonus: Plays some games pretty well! I was surprised because I wasn't expecting this at all. Anything with lots of menus like Ingress shows up too squished to read, but puzzle games like Marvel Puzzle Quest work fine.Cons:- The USB charging port requires a specialized micro USB cable (which comes with the phone). I'm not sure if it's the port itself being finicky, or the special cable (since I only have the one and cannot test it) but sometimes it takes a little experimentation to get the cable to sit the right way for the phone to charge. This can be a pain on the road when driving in a car as the phone can sometimes easily slip away from the USB charger.- The small phone size means the screen is WICKED small, so the digital keypad takes some getting used to, or may simply be impossible to use if your fingers are large. Since this sized screen is probably beyond even the general min-spec for mobile, you'll sometimes bump into cramped or hard to read layouts in apps and websites. For my needs, this hasn't been a problem but I wanted to note that this wouldn't be a great phone for folks with big hands or with troubles viewing small-sized text.",3.0

278943,"Oneplus One Plus One FDD LTE 4g Mobile Phone 5.5"" 1080p Snapdragon 801 3gb RAM 64gb ROM Android 4.4 NFC Cyanogenmod Cm11s (Standard)",,198.42,4,"So far, using this phone has been 95% the best experience I've ever had with mobile phones. The other 5% are small issues that I've managed to fix, but shouldn't have to.Full disclosure: This review is centered around me using SultanXDA's CM12.1 rom. I have no idea how stock operates in comparison, and I would HIGHLY recommend using SultanXDA's rom.There are some microphone issues in calls, wherein you may sound like you're underwater to the other person. I have searched and found that turning off Google Now's system-wide activation may fix it. There's also a zip file that Sultan has posted in his XDA thread that may have had some part in fixing it. If your call quality ends up having issues under Sultan's rom, and this ends up fixing it, spread the word! The more that this issue's fix is found on Google, the better.First off, the screen. That thing is beautiful. Full 1080p, with 3 capacitive buttons right below it: Menu, Home, and Back (from left to right). While that was a little confusing at first (very used to having a physical button, and used to having back on the LEFT), I've grown accustomed to it. There's an RGB notification light right next to the front-facing camera.The back of the phone has a very nice texture. It makes it feel like a premium phone, honestly. I believe it's what you would call a sandstone finish. Fantastic-feeling, just slightly grippy enough to provide one-handed safety while using the phone.The build quality of the whole phone is quite decent, especially for a budget phone. No creaking, no loose buttons, camera is protected from surfaces by having a very slightly protruding area around it and the flash LED.Speaking of the camera, both of them are quite nice. The less-impressive front-facing camera can do 1080p at 30fps, while the rear-facing camera can do 4k at 30fps! If you want higher framerates, the rear-facing camera can do 1080p at 60fps, or 720p at 120fps as well. That being said, you WILL need to use a custom rom for those. I know that SultanXDA's cyanogenmod rom includes the snapdragon camera app, as well as some drivers to allow the app to use those resolutions/framerates.However, pictures and video are not perfect - they often are a little blurry. That's not awful, especially for the price, but it is a bit worse than I was hoping. Quality issues may differ based on how shaky you are - I have very unsteady hands, so micro-shaking could be blurring the picture a LOT.Battery life on SultanXDA's rom is seemingly fantastic. I have only had this for a couple days, now, but it's performed rather well, with an estimate of 10-12 hours of screen-on-time from a 100% charge. Standby battery life is absolutely great. I had the notification LED flashing for close to 9 hours while the phone was in standby, and lost only 3% battery over the course of that 9 hours. You WILL want to use a 2amp charger with it, though, as normal chargers will take upwards of 10 hours to recharge the phone- really only useful to keep it going over the course of the day. With a 2amp charger, I estimate it would probably take 2 hours to go from near-empty to 100%, based on my observations.Performance in games is pretty good. SultanXDA's rom underclocks the CPU a little so that it doesn't get temperature-throttled during heavy use, and as such, gaming performance is likely a tiny bit worse because of that. But I was able to run a couple dreamcast games at almost fullspeed the entire time, and Aaaaaaaa, Kami, Minecraft PE, and Osmos HD all ran at fullspeed. Need For Speed: Most Wanted looked like it might have been running at a tiny bit lower than 30fps, but I'm not sharp enough to estimate properly.I subtracted one star because of the microphone issues, the less-than-desired picture quality out of the cameras, and the lack of a microsd slot, with the last one being the straw that broke the star's back.Overall I'd rate this a 9/10, but Amazon doesn't have that sort of granularity! Excellent phone for me, mileage may vary.",0.0

The Moto G4 is far superior to all of those but it doesn't have the same magic that the original Moto G had.I really think that Google took over Motorola and made the Moto G1 with the main intention of making the company more appealing to sell. Google sold Motorola for a very good profit to Lenovo shortly after the great success of the Moto G. I still have my Moto G1 and very much cherish that phone for it's great features and excellent build quality.I purchased the Moto G4 with 64gig hd and 4 gig of RAM so that I wouldn't need to worry about space for my apps. Converting micro SD cards as internal storage in Marshmellow doesn't work as well as it should. Apps need to be supported for this feature and only a handful in the app store seem to be. Plus only very high speed memory cards will work properly. All three of my class 10 cards by PNY, Sandisk, and Lexar get a warning stating that they are too slow when I try to make them part of the internal storage. The screen is sharp although I prefer the look of the 5.5 inch 1080p IPS screen on the iPhone 6plus. I don't know what it is but the screen on the Moto G just doesn't have the same vibrancy or quality. Still, the Motor G4 screen is plenty bright and nice to look at.The front facing speaker sounds great and buttons feel mostly responsive when pressed. The fingerprint scanner works better than any other phone I've tried.Turbo charging is also a great feature that I couldn't live without especially since I usually have to charge the Moto G4 in the afternoon to comfortably get through the evening. I've been getting about 4 hours of screen on time between charges. The camera takes decent pictures and focuses quickly. Most everything on this phone is really nice and snappy. NFC might be a feature some will miss, not me though.Even though to me the Moto G4 doesn't make me giddy like the orifinal Moto G, my opninion is that you can't go wrong with this purchase. The Moto G4 really is a good phone for someone who needs a device that works well, has the important premium features, and doesn't break the bank.",11.0

I thought something was going to be really terrible about it. However, being a poor college student I had no choice but to get a cheaper phone.I received this phone and have now been using it for a few weeks. I compare this to my husband's phone (new samsung) and I am very pleased with it. It is only a little slower (not by much) than his, and a little grainier photos. Other than that, I have some bonuses he does not have on his Samsung. Duel sim card, costs only $90, and comes in pretty rad colors. Also cam with a case and screen protector. This phone also has lots of case options online.The small differences this phone has can never add up the $300 difference in my opinion. This phone is pretty amazing for the price. I think even if I could get the more fancier phone, I rather save the money since the differences are very small in my opinion.The two things that do kinda drive me crazy I hope they change is the charging port is at the top of the phone and not the bottom. It makes it hard to talk while it is charging or even use the phone. Second, it constantly says second sim card is missing. I don't use it, and wish it would turn off the notification.

402155,Sudroid Z6 Waterprrof Shockproof Dustproof Unlocked Smartphone IP68 Dual Core 1.3GHz MTK6572W 4GB Android 4.2 4.0 Inch IPS Screen 3G Support(Orange),LuMen,94.99,2,"The screen had some vertical lines since day 1, and it is exactly 40 days after purchase today and the USB connector on the phone just gave out. It will not ""connect"" to any device or charge the battery with any cord or plug. This is very frustrating as the warranty just ran out 10 days ago, the phone has not received any bad treatment (though it DID PASS WATER TESTING as it was briefly submerged in a bucket of water for a few seconds during the first week). Not really worth $138 dollars in my opinion.Also, for other prospective buyers, note worthy that because of the deep set position of the micro USB female connector to accommodate waterproof features, the insertion plug is EXTRA long so it is not possible to buy just any micro USB cord and use it. It will not work without modification of the male micro USB portion of the cord.",2.0

This phone won't last 6 hours on a charge and I have had a hard time finding a cable that work's. I'm using the cable that came with my Samsung table it's the only thing that works. I took the phone off charge this morning at 6 AM it was charged to 100% it's 11:30 now and it's down to 60% I'll have to charge it before the day is over and all its done is receive 15 emails and sent and received 7 texts. Looks like the phone has been dropped there is scaring on the top right corner by the head phone jack. Lot of road rash for a NIB phone.

It's inexpensive, runs great, is absolutely beautiful, and has a front facing flash. Yes, a front facing flash! The HD screen is great for watching videos on and is very responsive. The phone doesn't have an app drawer, and the apps are all laid out on the screen, pretty much like an iPhone only you can add widgets and stuff. This is a drawback for some people, but it's one of my favorite things about this phone. The sound is very loud, which is great when I lay on my good ear (I'm half deaf in my left ear) in bed and want to watch YouTube videos. Works in perfect harmony with my LG G Watch, and the special little notifications menu thing has all sorts of convenient things that you can do, like turn the wifi or bluetooth on and off, audio profiles, airplane mode, FLASHLIGHT. Most phones you'd buy for this price come with an outdated version of android, but with this phone here oh no, you get Lollipop (At the time I'm writing this, it's the latest version of Android). If you don't want to use it as a phone, and you just want to play music and stuff on it and check your facebook, that's cool too! I've had phones that gave me a no service message when it didn't have any service (Ohhhh gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood), but all this does is have a little notification icon on the notification bar of a sim card.

For the girls that love, love pink this is the phone, needless to say something lady like.As I began to use the phone I ran into a few snags, I couldn't get the internet, so because I have AT&T I called them for some assistance. Boy, I have to tell you that experience was so frustrating I can't begin to tell explain what I was feeling!!!!!!! So in there explanation AT&T advised me to contact Nokia, my goodness it felt just like I was speaking with AT&T, let me tell you this went on for 6 hours with me trying to get some help, by then I was almost ready to pull my hair out.I felt just like a tennis ball getting hit back and forth between AT&T & Nokia putting the blame on each other. So I had a light bulb moment something said call the company where I purchased the phone from to see if they could help. I called and explained my frustration and the staff person actually listened, he really listened! OK, I began to feel like I was batting a thousand .The gentleman stated that he would have 1 of his tech call me back to assist me about 1 hour went by and I got a call from the gentleman stating that they were having some pc issues and that he wanted to let me know that he didnt forget about me. Which was sooooo nice.So the next day I called it took all of 15 minutes to fix a small issue that the large companies couldn't fix in 6 hours. Now that's what I call great and outstanding customer service, needless to say that I'm still in love with my cell phone. This is a great company to purchase items from I have spread the word.

My Samsung broke and was insured by Assurion who wanted me to pay a $175 deductible after which they would send me a refurbished S3 which I could buy for $160 on the open market. It was a ""no brainer"" to make the switch. The BLU is cheaper and just as good. I have cancelled all my insurance plans with Assurion and will replace the other four phones on my account with BLU when necessary.I am saving $40 per month on that useless benefit.Pros :One) Less Expensive then Samsung and the same good quality (compared to the S3) of its Battery Life, Telephone Call Quality,Data Connection and Video.Two) No need for insurance as it is so inexpensive I can afford to buy another it it breaks after the warranty. (In fact I bought a second model, The BLU Life One, in case I have to send it in for a repair).Three) Just inserted my t-mobile chip into the phone and it worked.Cons:One) Sometimes the GPS is confused. I switched settings to GPS device only and the quality is now just as good as the S3Two) Sometimes an APP stalls. If I swipe off all the closed Apps listed in the manager the problem is reduce considerably. It it persists, I reboot the handset.Three) Handset to large for my hand.Four) Menus are slightly different but the learning curve is not difficult.Five) Phone came with a spare screen protector.

93173,"Blackberry Curve 8520 Unlocked Quad-Band GSM Phone with 2MP Camera, QWERTY Keyboard, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth - Lavender",BlackBerry,39.99,5,"the 8520 phone actually works well on at&t! no matter how much you learn the iphone keyboard, a blackberry full physical qwerty still wins, hands down. the spell checker and predictive type on bberry is better vs iphone and with the physical keyboard you misspell a lot less. since you can sync your itunes on here you only ""miss"" the iphone for its apps which really only work best on wifi. 8520 is lightweight, fairly thin, very light, has nicely spaced keys, and really cool media controls blended into the top of the device. nice use of rubber here on the device too lends some durability to glossy plastic finish. I jammed a 16G nand flash card into it too so i have music, movies etc with me. I bought the unlocked version since i use the 8520 when traveling to US from abroad .... without a full blackberry data package you lose out on things like email and blackberry messenger - but this is my 2nd/travel phone so i dont care too much - I use it when in the US with pay as you go on at&t - i get what i want a phone that works, easy texting, wifi browsing and music/video. iPhone is my main phone abroad but it wont stay that way once renewal time comes. I could easily see 8520 being my main phone but if you want the mobile internet experience (3G) and slightly cooler packaging then go for the 9700, but you pay for it - a lot more. given cost differential I would easily buy 8520 over 8900 ...8520 just feels a tad cooler too vs 8900 still too corporate. yet both are pretty similarly equipped. if you had full blackberry data package with this as your main phone u r probably happy person. i am more than happy with this as 2nd/travel phone. Cool thing about this unlocked version is i can buy pay as you go sim card, slip it in and work no matter where i am. in past my edge (non3G) blackberries actually run things like google apps and internet fairly well. i am sure 9700 with full 3G is better but necessary??",60.0

123192,Blu LIFE 8 Unlocked (Orange),BLU,169.99,3,"I bought this phone as an upgrade to my Dash4.5, that was beginning to slow down under the pressure of ever-demanding applications. I was hoping to upgrade from the Dash Antutu index of 7k to the impressive Life Antutu index of 26k. The specs of this phone were definitely an upgrade, but the phone itself was somewhat of a disappointment.The Positives - The screen is crisp and viewable from most angles. The processing power is pretty good, although the speed is not blazing, as the specs would indicate. The music player is very good, particularly if you use a high-quality headset instead of the speaker or the stock headset. The GPS is responsive, and the download speed is fast, although not blazing. The phone connects to TMobile 3G very comfortably The camera is quirky, but pretty good. It might take a while to learn all of the features of the phone, since the settings and instructions are not entirely clear. The battery lasts more than 24 hours with medium use. The phone is pleasantly thin and light. The included case is a nice touch.The Negatives – The extra strip at the bottom is very annoying, aesthetically and operationally. The screen rotation does not always work, and sometimes it is sluggish; although most of the time it is pretty quick. The phone drops the connection frequently – sometimes it drops the connection with a “SIM card not found” message. The BlueTooth feature either does not work or does not work properly, I am not sure which.",6.0

Anyway, one thing to note that is not in any information, is that you need to buy a SIM card for the watch and actually have a telephone number set up so that the watch may receive and call out. I have spent many hours with this- I may be behind the times and this should have just been a known but not for me. I have had the run around with ATT setting mine up so you should ensure the cost before plunging ahead. They are charging me 40.00 a month! Thats another story, but just to know that ahead of time before you buy it.So, buy the watch, buy the SIM card and activate your device.

Had I received a working device out of the box, or brand new one, this review would be much more different.

201456,Huawei Mate 2 - Factory Unlocked (Black),Huawei,229.99,4,"i just got this phone and activated it through h20 wireless. it works great. everything works as advertised. for $299, this is a great deal compared to other phablets. samsung note 3 and lg pro 2 go are $500+PROS-factory unlocked-fm radiio-simplistic yet sleek and elegant-not a lot of bloatware.-has a glove mode. this is a very handy feature. taking off my glove to text each time gets very annoying.-powerful processor. runs very smoothly. good graphics.-great speakers. has outdoor mode for a louder ringtone.-awesome battery life. last a very long time. plus, it comes with reverse charging. i don't know any other phones with that feature.-comes with a screen protector on it already-and of course, it's aggressively priced against it's competitorsCONS-NO APP DRAWER!!! this is a huge one for me. im withholding a star for this. seriously, what kind of smart phone doesn't come with an app drawer. to get around this, i created folders to hold all the google apps, system apps, and bloatware i don't use. the folders themselves have a limited capacity of apps it can hold. i had to create a second folder. i tried to get around this by downloading an 'app drawer' and 'folder apps' from the playstore but to no avail. those apps didn't work. oh wells. the default folders will have to do for now.-on screen home, back, and menu buttons instead of capacity buttons. this is really personal preference, but personally, i prefer capacity buttons over on screen buttons. on screen buttons allows you to tweak the placement of the home, menu, and back button. but capacity buttons allow for more screen real estate instead.-both the power button and volume rockers are on the left side of the phone (not your left, the phone's left). it's not a huge deal, but it is naturally more intuitive to have the volume rockers and power buttons on opposite sides.overallgreat phone. good buy. im using out h2o wireless carrier with this phone for $30 a month. i highly recommend these lessor known phone and cellular companies over the ""giants"". that's not to say the ""samsungs"" and the ""verizons"" aren't good companies, but they do charge a premium. do your research and give these underdogs a try. besides, more competition in this field is good for the consumers.",4.0

This is my first time using a Huawei smartphone and I promise this is the best phone I have ever used! I have experienced iPhones for many years. The first time I grew tired of iPhone system (and how they purposely use update to worsen the older phones, just so you can buy newer version), I switched to a LG and it failed me miserably, the worst phone I have ever used. I switched back to iPhone and finally decided to try Huawei p9 plus. This phone amazed me!1. It came on time in a really really nice box. It's really easy to set up and google play and other google apps are installed. A transparent case and screen protecter included.2. The double-camera is TEN TIMES BETTER than iPhone 6 plus. All the filters and special effects are cool, make you feel like a pro photographer, it automatically makes your selfies prettier.3. The battery lasts super long. If I don't use it intensively, it will last two days. If I listen to music and stuff, it lasts 1.5 days.4. The fingerprint touch is on the back, which is really interesting to me.5. It gets better signal than iPhone for some reason in my area.6. Its ringtones are so beautiful and sound system is so strong!7. Storage and usage are efficient, it also has cleaning apps already there for you.8. It is just prettier: I got this Huawei Ascend P9 Plus Case, Premium Leather Cover with View Window Protective Smartphone Flip Cover Folio Case (Ultra Thin Slim)(Perfect Fit) by Grand (P9 plus Pink) to go with it, which shows time and weather in a small screen. No one I know has a phone looking cooler than mine.I can totally understand why US doesn't allow Huawei to sell their phones here, because if it is allowed, apple and samsung,LG would be at great risks.p.s. you might encounter one small thing if you are in the US. When you start to text, it might tell you that the number is invalid. All you have to do is change the number to international format, download Twitch! to do it or just type it in as +1 xxx-xxx-xxx, then everything will be fine. It's because this is an international phone.P.S.I bought the second one for my wife!Wow Google Map!",46.0

141683,"BLU Studio 6.0 Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,292.99,2,"I wanted to like this phone. For a little over $200 the specs seemed too good to be true, and that appears to be the case. I’ve had this phone (2 of them) for about two weeks. Most functions worked fine. The six inch screen was great, I wasn’t sure I’d like a screen that big but reading and surfing the internet during my hour commute on the bus was great with this phone. I’m on T-Mobile and the 4G connection was awesome. It also connected to my Fitbit Charge, which I had concerns about since it only had Bluetooth 3.0, this was good. Texting and phone calls were also fine, although I don’t do either that often.The first of my issues were with the audio. I listen to a lot of podcasts and the sound would just stop randomly when the screen is off. Sometimes I could listen for 30 minutes before the audio would just stop. The time indicator on the podcast player would continue forward but no sound would be playing, after about 30 to 60 seconds the audio would come through again. This would happen every 5 minutes or so. I thought it might be the app I was using but the audio stops in all audio programs, google music, Pandora locally played files. I sent this unit back for a replacement.On the second device I received I installed all my apps and everything was working great, for about half a day and then the audio issue started again. I did a factory reset of the phone thinking this would help. And it did for about a day and then the audio issue started again. But a few other issues popped up as well.I use Google Now as my launcher, but for some reason the phone would keep defaulting to the stock one, even after I set Google Now as my home launcher. Google Now wouldn’t even show up in the home setting of the phone.The other issue was the date and time. I’m on the west coast and the time would default to Eastern Time even with network provided time checked. Not that big of a deal, I could set it manually but it was bothersome.The last issue was messaging. I use hangouts as my default messenger. Everything was fine until the default messaging app would show notifications, even after hangouts was set as default.I gave it go, I googled, I read forums. I spent too much time trying to get this phone to do the simple things I wanted it to do, I just don’t have the time to invest to get it to work. It’s a shame because I really like the size, beautiful screen and great battery life.If you don’t need to listen to audio this may be the phone for you.",3.0

Other than that, after going through two updates via pc (no over the air update available), it's smooth, fast, and awesome. However, I don't know why Zune music is displayed instead of Xbox music even after updating the phone. Because of this , I can't use xbox music pass. Other than that, 16gb is plenty, (I had problems with LG L9 because it came with only 4GB, hard to install apps). No microSD though. I refuse to pay $700 for a phone. This is perfect. THere are many windows apps. I only use navigation, yelp, kindle, flixter, and audible so it's great. Oh and the GMail is not accessible, there is no app for it, you have to go to the browser. Bluetooth works great with my car. I canceled Rhapsody because Rhapsody on windows phone, at least this one, is slow and lagging. So I uploaded music tracks and the navigation for music is better than android apps I used before. Battery life is descent too. Phone is a lot heavier than say, LG Optimus L9 but have a stronger built feel than Lumia 521. I returned 521 due to volume button defect and freezing. It's funny because 521 had microSD and xbox music. Too bad button stopped working, 521 is cheaper too. But anyway I like this phone.PS: It came in AT&T packaging even though it advertised as Unlocked GSM. Phone also has AT&T logo on it. I am under TMobile. Anyway it works and I like windows better than android in terms of getting rid of default network provider's apps easily since I am on T Mobile. With an android phone, this would be impossible, at least the android phones I've used. For example, I tried hard to get rid of at&t apps on my Motorola phone when I switched to TMobile but I couldn't.",0.0

Back plastic feels a bit cheap due to material wise, however, still keeps up with a smooth and nice grip. Hand holding feels very study and mimics the timeless design of the HTC One. Front gorilla tempered glass is smooth and scratch resistant.-The screen is especially nice and beautiful. Color is true and vivid. Text is crisp and clear. Color theme is true, real and very pleasing to the eye. With the new Lollipop, graphic experience is even more beautiful and pleasing.-For average user such as phone calls, online, etc.. and 2-3 hour YouTube under LTE, battery life is awesome.-The dual sim does give convenience when travelling but the real deal is SD card.-The cameras are nice, both front and back. Auto focus is fast and picture/video quality is crisp and nice.Downsides:-Processor isn't the fastest.-Speaker is understated.-Less available accessories.-There really aren't any downside. Really there aren't any I could think of. For the money paid, I'm getting the best value, even more than how much paid for this phone. I'm literally holding the phone and look everywhere trying to knit pick/split hair and I guess people can ask for bigger battery, faster processor, finger-print reader, top notch newest camera, but really they aren't necessary to make it a nice phone; IMO they're there to lure consumers in keep paying for big brands.Overall, I have to say I'm impressed by the Maverick LTE design, features, and value.Thumbs up for Verykool",37.0

The look and solid feel are second only to a handful of phones. I've had both variants of the d855 and can say without a doubt, you want to get the 32 gigabyte version, as the extra RAM and space are very necessary. The screen is the shining star here.. Once you get used to it all 1080p screens look outdated and cheap (minus sony's z2, z3 screens.. they looks great at 1080p)I have bought (all outright, full price) a droid turbo, htc one m7, sony xperia z2, blu life pure mini, oneplus one, iPhone 5c, lg g2, and a couple others.. and the G3 is my daily driver. I am replacing it with a Note 4, but not for any reason other than I want a phone with a fingerprint scanner and big 2k screen. The 32GB G3 bought now at these prices (so LOW) will be a fine device for atlas another year, maybe even two, that will be as quick as most everything else out there.The Bad: this is the intl. version, so NO 4G in the USA. mine is plenty fast on H w/ AT&T but this may really bug some people. The one issue I always have had with the phone personally though was the SoC. The SD 801AC is a beast of an SoC and paired with the Adreno 330, it halls balls. BUT, it wasn't quite ready to power a 2k screen AND handle heavy multitasking/gaming. So from the get-go you'll notice ""micro-lags"" all over the place. You do get used to it, and it's nothing to noteworthy, but it is there. And when you start really throwing a lot of tasks at the phone you'll see screen stutters quite a bit. My first g3 from amazon (the 16gig) had AWFUL sound from the AUX port.. I mean bad. On my new g3 (the 32 gig) the sound couldn't be better. Loud and clear.. its Apple quality. So I chalk up the bad experience on my first one to a bad device.I would recommend this phone to anyone who wants a flagship, with 2k screen.. but doesn't want to spend a ton of money outright. And unless you do a ton of Youtube on your mobile data plan, the lack of LTE will go unnoticed for the most part.If you can afford to spend and extra $100 get the Galaxy Note 4",0.0

My last smartphone, (which was also LG) Was a little outdated, but it worked great. When i saw first hand, the size of the new wave of ""Phablets"" I knew i couldn't purchase a normal sized phone. The problem came down to pricing. When i first heard of this phone, it's size, it's features, and most importantly, it's price I knew I couldn't pass it up. The phone came early, I went down to my carrier (Metro PCS) got it set up, and BAM! I love it! Now this may not be typical, but a slight word of caution: i have big hands, so this phone fits great, but I don't feel very confident walking around moving this as i would a normal sized phone. The phone is kinda slick, and the size (in smaller hands) might make you a little nervous handling it. Thankfully, they're plenty of options when it comes down to cases that offer grip, and protection. I have one on the way as i type.

392162,Sony Xperia XZ - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - Forest Blue (US Warranty),Sony,649.99,3,"The Xperia XZ is truly a beautiful device. While the ""slab"" appearance my turn some people off, it's very comfortable to hold, and is narrow enough that it never feels like it's about to fly from your hand. The display, while not mind-boggling in terms of specs, borrows heavily from Sony's television expertise, and looks more ""natural"" playing HD movies than the iPhone 7 Plus and Galaxy S7 Edge.Sound quality, while maybe not quite to BoomSound's bar on earlier HTC devices, is also surprisingly good. It may not be the ""best"" Android device I've used for media consumption, but its the most enjoyable.Signal quality is something of a mixed bag. In places where other phones have marginal LTE coverage, I noticed the Xperia would drop to 3G more often than not. In places with stronger LTE coverage, I was seeing results like this when comparing with the same SIM:OnePlus 3: 32mb down / 8mb upGalaxy S7 Edge: 33mb down / 8mb upiPhone 7 Plus: 35 down / 7mb upXperia XZ: 27 down / 4mb up(Tests were run multiple times, and results are rounded and averaged.)The digitizer is nice and accurate, with almost perfect sensitivity. And throughout the device, there are numerous design cues that took me back to the Clie series of PDA's back in the long-long-ago. Even the no-needle-necessary SIM/SD tray is a welcome addition. You really do get a sense that this phone is ""expensive"" and attention was paid to every detail.Except one.This should all point to a higher rating, but the disappointing and deal-breaking discovery for me is that Sony chose to disable adoptable storage (at the time of this writing, there's not very extensive coverage of the phone, so this may be a more obvious deficiency in the future). I knew out of the gate that this only has 32GB, but with the inclusion of MicroSD support and every other ""nice"" feature of the phone seems to imply that it would just be there. It isn't, and enabling it over ADB doesn't work. So out of the box, with only software updates to the preinstalled apps and two weeks worth of my GMail account, 40% of the internal storage was already spoken for.While that might be acceptable for many, the second shoe dropped when it came to using the SD card as a media repository. Playback of Sony's own demo movies from the card (A Class 10 SanDisk Ultra) were choppy, and the transfer speed was dramatically slower than in my S7 Edge. My guess here is for whatever reason, Sony decided to go cheap here.And that, sadly, is why I'll be returning the phone. Were it not for that awful decision, it would be hands-down the best Android device I've used.",17.0

My last phone (Galaxy SIII) was super quick at taking photos, even if they were blurred from the motion. I decided against the Xperia Z5 compact because of all the reviews on the slow camera speed. The X Compact appears to load the camera much quicker than what I saw in videos for the Z5 Compact, especially if you load by double clicking the power button. (it's a slower load via the dedicated camera button.) The shutter speed, however, is quicker than my husband's Xperia Z3 flagship, but still slower than my Galaxy S III. Even so, the auto focus does act pretty quickly, and it seems quicker the better the lighting is. The picture quality is pretty good, though, except that the colors are on the bluish side in dim lighting.Speakerphone quality: How is it 2016 and speakerphone quality is worse than before?! Maybe it's a Sony problem. Husband's Z3 is barely audible on speakerphone, and the X Compact made only slight improvement. It's audible when it's dead quiet around you, but less so when I'm walking the dog outside, and near impossible when I'm in the car. What's the big deal about these front facing speakers if I can't hear the other person very well?! (note: speakers seem to be great for playing videos and games.)Phone still gets 4 stars because of all the other nice features everyone else had already reviewed.

Ordered on a late Tuesday night, the package was delivered Friday evening but wasn't expected to arrive until the following Wednesday. So far, I like the phone. It's fast, sound quality is nice. Texting is enjoyable on the keyboard. I'm an android/physical keyboard lover so this phone is great for me. I've heard that the phone's amount of internal memory is a problem for most people. I downloaded about 10 apps so far and they aren't posing a problem. GPS is pretty fast where I am. It's an AT&T phone but I'm using it just fine on T-Mobile's network. I like that it allows you to set different sounds for different notifications (text, e-mail, calender news, etc). Setting custom mp3 ringtones was a breeze. I'm not big into using FB and Twitter anymore so I can't say anything on the use of the Facebook button or Twitter app. It did come with a FB chat widget upon first turning on the phone. Battery life doesn't seem that great but I don't mind charging it every day before bed. The camera is nice if you're upgrading from a 3.0MP/no flash phone like me. If you've had an iPhone or any phone in that range then it's def a downgrade. It all depends on what you want in a phone. This isn't an extremely high caliber phone like the iPhone or Samsung Galaxy SIII so if you just want a phone for texting, calling, a few apps, a decent social networking experience, then this is the phone for you...especially if you like physical keyboards :) Also if you use instagram, the phone will rotate the app so you have to turn the phone to use it, making the pictures smaller but still visible. Just a heads up. Also I was expecting a new phone but when I opened the packaging, it seemed used. Everything was in unsealed but neat plastic and there was a gray gash on the bottom left corner of the phone. This doesn't bother me that much considering I've been without a phone for a while and I don't want to wait through sending the phone back and getting another one. Will be looking out for any issues though.",4.0
260928,NOKIA 301.2 FACTORY UNLOCKED QUADBAND 3G 850/1900 WORLD PHONE - WHITE,Nokia,269.1,4,"Originally bought 1/28/2014. Amazon changed the date of my review when I updated/edited a few things in 2015. I made a second edit 8/28/2016. See end of review for this update.I have been searching for a feature phone since my trusty Sony 580 died over a year ago. I neither have, nor want, a data plan. I don't use internet on my phone. I was happy to find that Nokia was still developing for this market with something more than your bottom-of-the-barrel Go-Phone, which is what I had been using since the demise of my Sony.I have had the phone about a year. I don't love it like I did my Sony, even though it has some features that are better than the Sony, like standard jacks. Here are my opinions/experiences with this phone:  Pros:        1.)  It works as a phone - I can hear my callers and they can hear me. When set on full volume, calls through the handset are uncomfortably loud. (Not so much through the speakerphone - see Cons, below.) Clarity could be better - the sound IS NOT comparable to a land line phone - but voices are less muffled than on the cheap Go-phones with which we've been making-do. I've never had a smart phone, so can't compare the sound quality to a high-end phone.2.)  It has 10 alarms that can be set for any day of the week or one time only, with a snooze function that is variable between 2 & 59 minutes. You can choose your alarm tone.3.) The calendar has multiple choices of reminders, including birthday and anniversary that calculate age and are set for the life of the phone. You can also set these reminders through the directory.4.) The calculator has the normal calculator functions, but can also be used as a scientific or a loan calculator. It also has these common choices: 1/x; %; square root; x squared; MS (memory store); MR (memory recall); C (clear); and plus-minus.5.)  Notes and To-do lists. As a trial, I put in 21 To-Dos and 30 Notes. 30 is the limit for notes. Probably the same for To-Dos.6.) Speakerphone/loudspeaker for calls and music  7.) Stopwatch8.) Countdown timer with alarm9.)  You can set it to 3G, GSM or dual mode. Better battery life with GSM.10.)  Flight Mode. Easily accessible.11.)  You can add units to the conversion calculator. This is particularly useful since this phone was not developed for the US and many US equivalents were not included. For instance, there is a conversion for Acres to Square Kilometers but not to Square Miles. The is even a folder for ""Lifestyle"" conversions to add equivalents not found elsewhere. I added Miles per Hour vs. Kilometers per Hour, as there is no velocity converter. All converters are backwards compatible.12.)  Unit lights up briefly to alert you when fully charged, but does not play a tone. This is infinitely better than my Go-Phone that would awaken me when I was charging the battery overnight.13.)  You can opt out of emergency alerts. My Go-Phone had no such option. Amber/Silver alerts are important, but not in the middle of the night or when I get an alert from 300 miles away. I can opt in again if weather alerts are likely.14.)  You can set an access code separate from a pin code to control access to certain operations like the browser,  app purchases and downloads.15.)  You can set a time limit on your phone Profile (normal, silent, meeting, etc.) so you don't have to worry about forgetting to reset your phone after you've been to the movies, etc.16.)  I had no trouble with MMS messaging. I didn't have to do anything to set this up with ATT. It worked right out of the box. Unlike some other  reviewers, my phone is recognized as a ""dumb phone"" by ATT. 17.)  Has a radio and a music player. I have some issues with ringer & speakerphone volume, but not with radio & music volume. I often listen to podcasts & I can hear the spoken word clearly without earbuds. Radio only works with earbuds, as earbuds function as antenna. You can set it to play through the earbuds or through the speakerphone speaker. 3.5mm standard earbud jack.(Update: got a tablet that is much more convenient for podcasts. Still use the phone as a radio and love this function.)18.) Standard micro USB charging jack. Infinitely preferable to proprietary jacks!19.) Programable left and right selection keys. I programed my left key for a list of shortcuts to tools/apps that I either use infrequently or are difficult to remember how to access.  My right key is programed to take me to my address book.20.) Programable soft keys. A straight press of the central Navigation key takes you to the Menu screen. Pressing the sides of the Navigation key up, down, left or right functions as soft keys. You can program these soft keys with frequently used shortcuts, like Create a Message, or to take you to the Calendar or Calculator.21.) You can designate one person as your most frequent text recipient. Very convenient!22.)  The home screen is divided into four four separate sections for very frequently used items. The top section is slightly bigger than the others. You can choose from 10 items or you have the option to leave a section blank. Choices are: Calendar, Clock, Countdown Timer, General Indicators (I have no idea what this is. When chosen, it simply reads ""empty.""), Mail for Exchange, Mail, Notifications, Radio & Media, Shortcut Bar, SocialAccount or (empty).  I use the first section to display the time. On the next, I display the date, which also shows the next calendar entry, if there is one. My third section choice is Shortcut Bar, from which I can choose from 53 different shortcuts. Obviously, these shortcut choices are expanded from the original 10 choices given above. (This Shortcuts BAR is also different from the Shortcuts LIST I set up as accessible through my left selection key.) Some of the expanded choices: alarms, camera, calculator, etc. I currently have 15 items on this shortcut bar. I don't know if there is a limit or if you can choose all 53 shortcuts.  My fourth section is the countdown timer. I don't really use it all that often, but learned that this is the only way to easily display how much time is left on the timer when I do need a timer.Cons:1.)  There is no Tools file, but there are TWO Apps files.Apps file contains:  GamesAlarm clockCalculatorFilesVoice recorderTo-do ListNotesCountdown timerStopwatchAlso, within the Apps file is a folder called My Apps which contains: eBuddy (a now defunct chat app that eats up 615 kb)FacebookGoal (a soccer app, for pete's sake, that eats up 231 kb!)Mail for ExchangeNews and OffersNokia NearbyNotificationsSocialAccounts (to manage social networking)Store (Nokia app store to buy apps)The Weather ChannelTuneWikiTwitterWhatsAppand World Clock. In addition, there is ANOTHER icon on the Menu Page called More Apps, to store all the apps you buy or download. Can we perhaps have just ONE apps file for ALL the apps and a separate Tools file? Oh, and Calendar is a file by itself on the Menu Page. Might have been a good place for TOOLS! (Just saying...)2.) I cannot delete any of the pre-loaded apps from the phone. I equate this to bloatware. I am perfectly capable of choosing my own apps, thank you!3.) In order to delete any of the pre-loaded apps, (Facebook, WhatsApp, Mail for Exchange), from the shortcuts list, (the one I access from my left selection key), you have to go to Options, Select Options, open Applications List, then unmark the pre-loaded apps, then press Done. Took me a week of playing around to figure this out. Most of the other tools you might want on a shortcut are simply listed under Options. 4.)  There are four apps, (Store, Facebook, WhatsApp & Mail for Exchange), that you cannot delete from the Shortcut Bar. I NEVER use these apps, so find it irritating that I can't delete them. At least I can arrange the bar so that my frequently used shortcuts are listed first.5.)  Phone is very slick, especially the face. The keys are slightly convex. This combines into a less than stellar texting experience as my fingers frequently slide off.  And I feel the need to grip the phone tightly so I don't drop it. Getting a case helped.6.) If you want to add a new contact, you can only add their number and first and last name from the add contact screen. In order to add other information, you have to edit a contact. In order to edit a contact, you have to go to Names, then Select that Name (which feels like you would then call that person, but you don't) which takes you to a list of options, none of which is Edit. You then have to choose the left selection key labeled Options, then Add detail, where you can add numbers, add internet (web and email addresses), add multimedia (specify a ringtone or add an image, or add personal info (street address, birthday, note, formal name, nickname, company, & job title). In my Sony phone, you just had to highlight a contact name and hit edit which took you to a scroll down menu where you could edit/input info. 7.) You can't block calls from specific numbers, although you can block all calls. 8.) Menus, folders and files are not intuitive. You can probably finally find what you want if you are willing to devote a lot of time to playing with the programming, but this might be frustrating for users who are not comfortable with technology. 9.) Useless low battery notification. Mine notified me, (and I am being generous), maybe 3 sec before it died. Not enough time even to say ""I think my phone is going to die"" before it croaked. Sometimes, I swear, there is no notification at all. On my old phone I had at least 30 seconds, if not longer. Usually enough time to plug in before it died.10.) Really low ringtones and alarms/alerts. I've only downloaded one new ringtone, (brand-new, not copied from the Sony data card), but it isn't any louder than the ones already on the phone. I have everything set as loud as it will go, but ringtones are still almost mute. But at least I can hear callers. Speakerphone also low volume. Almost, but not quite, useless. Oddly enough, the standard tone for calendar alerts is reasonably loud. Unfortunately, you can't choose this tone for other things. I also tried recording loud tones through the Voice Recorder. Still comes out almost too low to hear. I wear the phone against my body and almost always feel or hear the vibration of a current call, so I can deal with this irritation. Oh, and turning off your phone or putting it on Silent does not turn off alerts. I have not yet found where you can choose to mute alarms for a period of time, like when in a theatre. I am going to be in trouble when I am someplace quiet and a calendar alarm goes off!  11.) Battery life nowhere close to what was advertised. I usually read/write 2-3 texts per day, have 3 daily alarms, occasional calendar reminders and talk anywhere from 1 to 3 hours per day.  My battery is then almost fully depleted. I MUST charge every night. As a test, I talked for an hour on a fully charged phone. When done, I was down one of the four bars indicating battery life. It took 54 minutes to re-charge the battery to full. I had hoped to be able to talk about 6 hours and still use all the other functions as needed. Not possible. If I have a heavy texting day, the battery life plummets. Texting just eats the battery up! Invest in a car charger - you'll need it. However, if you don't use the phone, you could probably get 5 - 7 days between charges. I have recently ordered a new OEM battery. If my experience varies from the past, I will update this review. (Update: new battery made no difference in battery usage. Texting still eats up the battery and I still charge every night.)12.) Phone resets itself to its default ringtone even though I copied tones from my Sony and set them as ringers for specific callers. New ringtones are on my data card, and the phone recognizes them, but I would have to reprogram the phone every day or two to have vanity ringtones. Life is too short. I gave it up and just use the default. 13.) There  is no way to turn predictive text on or off forever. You change capitalization by clicking ""#"" but if you click it too fast, you turn on/off predictive text. Also, no choice for numeric only. You choices are: ""ABC, Abc or abc."" if you want to use numbers in your texts, you must press and hold the key several seconds until the number pops up. 14.)  Loses texts. The texting feature includes being able to read whole conversations, however, don't expect it to sort your responses correctly! I often find texts from different people in the wrong conversational folder. Also, it randomly loses texts entirely. I recently (11/19/14) tried to look up a text that I specifically remember getting approximately 9/23/14. I looked through ALL my folders and this text is just gone. 15.) Several times now, the phone has ""frozen"" and begun vibrating and buzzing loudly. Then no buttons work. It has done this most frequently while listening to saved music files for a long period of time. For instance, I downloaded some white fan noise to help me sleep when traveling. The phone froze and buzzed several nights in a row while I slept, waking me from a sound sleep like a fire alarm. The only way to stop it is to pry off the back and remove the battery - not something easily accomplished when you've just awakened in a panic! I finally decided to leave the back cover off and just use the rubber case to protect the phone. Final Analysis: if I knew then what I know now, I don't know if I would still buy this phone. Most of the Cons are just minor annoyances but the freezing thing is pretty serious. Makes me question the longevity of the phone. Compared to smart phones, this phone is pretty cheap at about $85 out-of-pocket, but since I am one frugal mama, that is still expensive to me, especially if it is going to crap out after only a year or two. I might have been better off with an older high-end feature phone - one developed before smart phones took over the market. I seriously doubt this was engineered as well as Nokia feature phones were in the past.Update 8/28/2016: Well, I guess I have an answer to whether or not I would choose this phone again - I would. Or at least I would if it hadn't doubled in price since I bought it! I don't know how a discontinued ""dumb"" phone goes from $89 in 2014 to $199 in 2016. That is just insane! It isn't that great a phone! I liked a lot of the features, like having 10 alarms, and having birthday reminders in my calendar that also told me how old the person was, but not enough to pony up $200!I am a creature of habit, but I'm also a cheap SOB. When the Nokia literally took a nap with the fishes, I looked around for a new phone and ultimately decided I would buy another 301 - until I saw how outrageously they are now priced! Unfortunately, I also discovered in my research that there are 3 versions of this phone, only one of which will continue working in the USA after Dec, and only Amazon is selling that version. (Model RM-841. This info can be found on the white label under the battery.) Rather than pay the new extortion price, I hopped over to Kroger and bought a $20 Go Phone. Do I like it? No. It irritates the living daylights out of me! But when I think about it costing only $20 - I get a whole lot happier!One last Con I discovered since I had to get a new phone: you can port a phone's worth of contacts TO the 301, but woe unto you if you need to port your contacts from the 301 to another phone! The Go Phone necessitated a new micro sim card. AT&T couldn't read my old mini sim, even though I could still access it thru the 301. (Water damaged the in & out mics, but the rest of the phone works.) I had to bluetooth/slam each contact to the new phone individually: a process that took me over 4 hours!Update 9/14/2016: It took 2 weeks in industrial strength dessicant, but the 301 has been resurrected! All functions appear to have returned to normal. After a few weeks with the horrible Go-phone, I have upped my review to 4 stars. I know this phone won't last forever. I just ordered some cheap rubber port covers to try to avoid the humidity issues that almost trashed it this summer. I know I will be forced into a smart phone sooner rather than later, but I found I definitely like this phone better than anything else I can afford right now. (But it is still horribly overpriced at $200!)",13.0

Great phone to replace my aging iPhone 5S, which I can now use as a fancy iPod touch, hehe. TL;DR @the bottom and heading of this review! (Though I do recommend you read most of if not all of this quality review, most of it has some good and useful info I'd say!)Mini-rant on why this is such a great deal and why cell phone companies are stealing your money, essentially:I love this, more so for the price over anything. There is no need to shell out upwards of $600.00 I'd say at the minimum for a phone that is not nearly worth that much, in my opinion, haha. This was an excellent price, it is paid in full, so I don't have to worry about monthly payments and giving AT&T (or any other cell carrier for that matter - I'm fairly certain all cell carriers do the sell your soul and hard earned cash for two year's ""payment plan"" See: Your phone bill every month if you got a smart phone from your carrier in store or ""directly from them"" under a 2 year payment plan. It's pretty evil, low, and sneaky, since almost any sales rep you speak with will avoid stating clearly what exactly it is they're doing with your money, while they did lower monthly data plan costs, this is where they catch you and make up for it, and help offset the cost of buying these nice smartphones from manufacturers. But, this is a rant for another forum...About the actual product itself, haha:Works great! Fast, slow at first but just uninstall and ""turn off"" as much crap as you can that comes pre-installed on most all Samsung Galaxy smartphones. This is my first Samsung Galaxy smartphone so I came to learn of all of this junk that comes with it, which is saddening, but still better than the previous generation iPhone, especially for the price I got it for. Upsetting there is no easy way that I know of to get it all fully off the phone, (it still takes up some amounts of memory on the phone, :() especially just the pure junk apps, programs, and features that just do absolutely nothing useful for you that other, smaller, faster, better apps can already.Wireless charging for smartphones??? HELLO FUTURE! While some or most may say this is a gimmick, I say go ahead and hunt on eBay for a cheap offer (got mine for $2.00-$4.00, too cheap to care exactly what it was haha) for a Samsung brand wireless charging pad for your Samsung Galaxy S6 or higher generation smartphone. The wireless charging is slower than cable charging for obvious reasons, long story short, it takes long for electrons to travel through air essentially and hit the Qi-receiver chip technology built into the S6 smartphones and later as opposed to forcing a piece of metal with charged electrons speeding down the cable highway to charge up your battery. They do sell ""Fast-charge"" capable Samsung Wireless charging pads, but these cost about $40.00 more than the normal ones by Samsung haha, so don't do that, especially for Samsung Galaxy S6 generations, because I don't think these smartphones have the capability to do *wireless* fast charge, I may be wrong, correct me if I am in the comments! I may update if I find or am proven otherwise! You can find cheap ""Qi-enabled/technology"" wireless charging pads directly shipped from China on eBay, Amazon, or other sites certainly too but IMO best route is eBay used - like new or good condition, to save that money! Mine works great like a dream, been using it for almost two weeks already, I love the little charging soft glow lights that inform you if your device is charging on the pad and if or when it is fully charged (does a color change blue then green when phone is fully charged).SAFETY FEATURES FOR DAYS!!!This phone is so much stronger on the market than iPhones for these specs, not meaning the security of the phone itself, but for you as a user and scenarios you'd encounter in the real world, just to specify. I would state that iPhones have best *security* (note the word change here) meaning they are hardest to ""hack"", ""break into"", or have somebody ""steal data"" from, but if you're on top of your phone, don't do sketchy things on it, and stray from as much 3rd party adware, apps, websites, and illegal stuff like me, then you're golden! It's really not that hard to do haha.Anyways, really rad safety feature I love most - the triple click lock button SOS messaging feature - when you triple click your lock/power on/off button it will immediately snap pictures from your front and rear facing camera, record audio for several seconds, and send your current location to 4 emergency contacts. Just imagine how this will change the lives of all people facing dangerous situations, now as soon as you sense trouble, reach in your pocket and triple click your lock button. Obviously still call 911 and such, but this will get out so much more information to so much more people faster, and I'm guessing you can reactivate this feature in succession, anyways, great feature changing the world yay.I may just resell my iPhone while it still has a good market value, we'll see, I may get sick of having a fancy iPod touch. Pro to deactivating your iPhone, while in ""No SIM"" mode, the battery lasts for weeks on a full charge on low battery mode if you never connect to WiFi. Mine can go a full day on 100% without dropping now haha.TL;DR: GREAT PHONE! GREAT PRICE! AWESOME SAFETY FEATURES THAT'LL CHANGE YOUR LIFE! WOOHOO! GET IT!",6.0

401923,Studio 7.0 LTE - Smartphone - GSM Unlocked - White,BLU,,5,"This thing is shockingly dope. While it may be too big to be a phone, it reminds me so much of a shrunken Nexus 7 with the ability to make calls, and that's such a compliment in all honestly. The screen is a bit low res, but it surprisingly doesn't look bad at all. Another surprising thing? The front facing speaker is pretty darn good too, and it makes this mini tablet/jumbo smartphone hybrid a fantastic media consumption device. On top of all that, it runs basically stock Android and has ridiculously good battery life. It can also be used upside down which is nice easter egg.Now onto the less than impressive things... The front camera is laughably bad. Honestly, don't ever use it. The main camera, however, is better than I expected (with decent lighting that is).It's too big to be a phone in scenarios such as running, putting in a pocket, etc.It's a tad ugly from the back, but surprisingly good looking from the front.For less than $200 you get an extremely solid mini tablet that so happens to be in the middle of an identity crisis. I myself go through identity crises from time to time, so I can relate. This gadget is dope. Whether you decide to use it as a phone out and about is up to you, but even if you decide not to it's a solid 7"" tablet that can replace your phone at home. Oh, and having full LTE support for GSM carriers in the U.S. (including T-Mobile's lucrative band 12) is just another bonus.",47.0

It is a refurbished phone but it's in excellent condition. No scratches or visible sign of use. Came in original box with all necessary accessories. All I had to do was slip my already owned and active AT&T sim card (from a broken phone I was replacing with this one) into the slot and voila! Back to business as usual. Didn't need to contact AT&T, unlock or register anything online, etc. It just works period. And is set for service in the United States, east coast to be specific. Thanks for excellent service and a perfect product. Please be advised that you may want to double check but I'm almost positive that this phone will only work with an AT&T plan and not T-MOBILE. I was told that the Skyrocket version of the Galaxy S2 was exclusive to AT&T. I am confident that it will 100% work great on AT&T networks but if you have any other cell carriers call them first and ask if the Skyrocket can be activated on their network.

It does what Nokia says and does it well. Yes the OS is a little old and slightly laggy under certain conditions but it's no deal breaker if you understand that and aren't expecting the latest and greatest. Mostly I use it for pictures, video and GPS/maps. I don't text or do the social media stuff because I have no data plan. Oh yea, I use it for telephone service also. For what I do, it excels. I especially liked that I can download and use Google Maps with it as well as a few other interesting time wasters. That said it's no Android or I Phone so don't expect it. If you want maximum apps, you're probably better off paying more and going with a newer phone OS. The only real problem I experienced was a result of buying an alleged ""used like new"" model. It wasn't. The included charger was a non Nokia that was broken and the micro sdhc card that was supposed to be included was MIA so you might want to stick with a new one.

I can say that this may be a phone that can be a poor backup for a proper phone built by Samsung or Apple, but is not to be taken seriously for a ""power user"" that might actually use the phone as a tool. Problems range from slow response and poor touch screen response. The packaging and all is slick and looks good but function is poor. As seem to be a new annoyance in some phones, battery removal is impossible so the is no way to do a hard reboot to clear the issues that may come up. The VERY biggest annoyance is the fact that some regular apps, mainly a use of ANY of the compass apps from the Play Store will not work...PERIOD. It's because they wont release the magnetic sensor they say is built into the phone. After much difficulty, I finally was able to contact their support. I went into detail concerning my issue with the compass app. They more or less BLU it off saying they don't use the magnetic sensor for app use. This is totally unacceptable as in certain trips, GPS is not available and compass is the only way to keep in the correct direction. I bought this to use as a total tool. I know it can be used as such if they corrected access. They simply choose not to. This goes for their line of Tablets marketed as IRULU, so just be aware that product has issues too. I will write an review on that product also.Bottom line, save your money and buy a used Samsung or iPhone or anything from a company that will support all Android functions.",2.0

The same Apps are available, including Microsoft Mobile Office and the Opera Mini Web Browser (pretty much the same that is available for Androids and the Kindle Fire HD 8.9"", Dolby Audio, Dual-Band Wi-Fi, 32 GB). One great difference is that the Nokia 603 cost me only a fraction of the price I paid and would have to pay for a new Nokia 808.

It seems very responsive, I have never noticed any lag at all. 4G speeds seem decent enough and it flies on wifi. The screen is a thing a beauty. Battery life is about a day which is what I expected from these types of smart phones.My wife got a Galaxy S4, and while I can tell it is faster and has more bells and whistles.... is it $500 better? NOPE.Some things I have noticed that do not detract from my experience, just things I wonder about...Once the phone turned itself off for no reason, and I had to remove and reseat the battery to get it to come back up. No idea why, had 50% or so of battery left. Strange.The touch screen doesn't like sweaty hands, I doubt this is a problem exclusive to the L9, just touchscreens in general. I was outside all day in the Texas summer heat the other day and someone called me.... I couldn't get it to register my finger swipe to answer the call, my finger was too sweaty. I had to find a dry spot on me to wipe it off (my sock was the only thing I was wearing that wasn't soaked to the bone) then call the person back. Maybe there is another way to answer a call I don't know about.The screen is really hard to see in direct sunlight, but then again so is my wife's GS4, our previous phones (optimus M and Galaxy S) and just about every cell phone I have owned in the last 10 years that uses an LCD screen. This is more of a gripe of LCD touchscreens in general, maybe someday they will come up with one you can see outside.The speakerphone at max volume sounds very echo-y if you are holding the phone. If you put it down on a flat surface it sounds better. Knocking down the volume a notch or 2 takes care of it.All in all I am very happy with it, and it was $500 cheaper than my wife's GS4.

185653,Honor 8 Dual Camera Unlocked Phone 64GB - Midnight Black - GSM - US Warranty,,449.99,3,"After going through 3x LG G-series phones in as many years due to lousy build quality (bad touchscreen, screen detachment, bad motherboard/boot loop issues), I decided to abandon the brand. As a consumer, I prize build quality, durability, intuitive controls, and bang for your buck. To put things in perspective, my favorite all-time smartphone design is the Motorola Defy: it was built like a tank and worked underwater; it was rugged--you could drop it and it would barely scratch (no need for a phone case); had minimal bloat-wear; and served perfectly as an Every Day Carry (EDC) workhorse. Unfortunately, due to the current marketing strategy for cell phones, phones like the Defy are unicorns: the market currently is littered with disposable consumer goods built to be glass houses so manufacturers can increase profit. This led to a frustrating search high and low for a mid-tier phone that had good reviews with a decent camera; good build quality; impressive specs for the money; and a solid User Interface (UI) experience. That is, until I came across Huawei, and the Honor 8.Professional and amateur reviews I found were nearly universally positive, pointing to a beautiful body design; good customer support; good camera; good specs, and compatibility with T-Mobile’s 12 band (a lot of other Chinese-made, and international-version phones don’t support 12 band). I started leaning towards purchasing an Honor 8 (U.S. Warranty), but the one thing that held me back were the divisive “love it or leave it” attitudes towards Huawei’s EMUI. Then, I heard they would be replacing EMUI 4.1 in the near future, and Amazon featured a deep discount on Black Friday for the phone (selling it under $300), so I pulled the trigger and made the purchase. I’m about 2 weeks into using this phone, and while I want to love my Honor 8 as much as I did my Defy, Huawei's EMUI 4.1 greatly reduces my enjoyment and experience. This is why I deducted two stars, as EMUI is non-intuitive, and can be extremely frustrating when you miss notifications because of EMUI settings. If and when Huawei updates EMUI away from 4.1, I will give an updated review.Pros:+The phone is relatively slim, and great for one-handed operation.+The phone is fast. The screen unlocks as soon as you touch the fingerprint sensor, and I haven’t experienced lag on any apps.+Battery life is really good. I can go through my commute and work day without having to charge my phone.+The camera is decent quality (minor lag at times when it’s trying to focus), and has friendly controls. I’ve been spoiled by LG’s cameras, but I feel the Honor 8 performs well.+Beautiful external design, but slippery. Definitely get a case for this phone if you don’t want it sliding around.+Vibrant display, and transition times between dark/brightly lit rooms is good.+The phone will turn on WiFi to connect to a known network when you’re in an area you frequent.Cons:-EMUI 4.1! EMUI 4.1!! EMUI 4.1!!!-Initial setup when switching from an old phone to the Honor 8 takes an extremely long time compared to stock Android. This is because EMUI has a bunch of settings you need to micromanage, ranging from app permissions, to notifications, to battery use. What I miss about LG is whenever I upgraded a phone, I’d just connect the two phones via NFC and everything would sync up.-Settings continued: rather than having everything default to being enabled, you have to manually enable some settings. This means if you’re not careful, some of your social media apps and email apps might not be protected by the Battery Manager. This means they won’t run when your phone is off, and you won’t get notifications. This was extremely frustrating on multiple occasions, especially when people were trying to contact me on messenger apps.-No app drawer. It took me a while to figure out how to add an app icon.-Speaker is loud enough, but sound quality is poor and really tinny. This can make listening to some voices (especially high-pitched ones) really annoying. Good luck if you like listening to music, too.-No accessories besides a quick charger. It would be nice if the Honor 8 came with headphones, or an additional USB C-cable.-Other non-intuitive UI: When you slide down for Notifications, the Shortcuts (WiFi, Bluetooth, Flashlight, etc.) section needs to be clicked to access said menu. It’d be better to just have both Notifications and shortcuts combined on the same screen, like with stock Android.-I’m unaware of any profile options: for example, if I want to turn off vibrate and reduce my notification/media/call sounds in the office, I have to play with the volume buttons each time, instead of clicking on a Profiles shortcut to select Home/Work/Outdoors.-Volume and Power (restart/shut down) options can only be accessed with the physical buttons. It would help with UI if we can just slide down to the Notification/Shortcuts menu and be able to digitally manipulate the settings. This would also reduce wear and tear on the physical keys, and let users continue to use the phone if the physical keys break.**If the options I’ve mentioned above are available with EMUI, it just goes to show how unintuitive the UI is. There’s a lot to be desired in terms of intuitive controls, and I really hope Huawei will update EMUI as soon as possible.Final thoughts: The Honor 8 is a great phone that suffers from bad UI design. If EMUI were designed as beautifully as the Honor 8 phone itself, or were replaced with stock Android, I would not hesitate to recommend this phone to friends and family. As it stands, however, I can only recommend this phone for people who are intermediate to advance users, who either enjoy micromanaging their settings, or are comfortable with doing so. Given the Honor 8’s current EMUI, I would not recommend this phone as a gift for someone new to smartphones (parents, grandparents, etc.). I'm not happy to give such an average review, because the Honor 8 has great specs, price, and looks. It's just the UI that suffers. If Huawei improves the Honor 8’s user experience, they will have a complete package with no rivals at this price point. So best wishes to Huawei, and I look forward to be given a chance to provide an updated, higher-rated review in the near future!",1.0

The phone works great! Everything was included as advertised. I had some initial trouble getting it on my phone carrier's network, but this issue and the responsibility of the issue is external of Amazon, the seller, or even the phone for that matter. That issue lies solely with the way that carrier locks an IMEI number to a SIM card, which all other carriers do not do. You can usually just swap an existing SIM into a new phone and go (usually with a couple hours before it autoconfigs). Not with MetroPCS.What can I say? The phone is great. The seller (BREED) was awesome and answered all my questions, and even provided options for me to return/refund/RMA/exchange the device while I was having issues getting it connected to the new network. Thankfully I was able to get the issue resolved without having to go that route.",2.0

That said, my T-mobile sim, unlocked, worked here in the US. Mercate group offered some solid customer service too.

I have to say; buyer beware if you are after a certain color! :) These are DAY GLO bright. His orange phone, which looks nice and muted in the picture online, arrived as hunting-vest orange. It.. is.. so.. bright. My phone is more of a robin's egg blue, but that's OK. Fortunately my husband didn't mind is day-glo phone! His response was, ""Well, at least I can see where I put it.""For the hands-on usage... It's OK, but it has its quirks. For some reason, it hesitates what seems like forever after I select the ""text"" app and try to send a message. I have to continuously tap my finger on the ""type text message"" box to get it to respond.Hearing on it isn't the best; I have the in-call volume all the way up and sometimes have trouble hearing my calls unless I'm in a quiet area. If you're in an area any louder than a grocery store (or watching a movie for example), you may have some trouble. It has a great loud ringtone though!I wish I could completely turn off vibration. I still get a vibration when I receive a text or when the phone is in-call and it ""connects"" to the number you dialed; even though I have vibration and haptic feedback turned off. Strange. This might be user error, but their manual doesn't specify very clearly if there IS a way to completely turn off all vibration. I'm not too bothered by it as I'm just using this strictly as a mobile phone and not an entertainment device. If it goes off once in a while, I won't die. I don't have battery/space hog apps such as Facebook installed, so my battery life is very good. It can last two days before I have to charge it.The screen is hard to see sometimes. You have to angle it ""this way"" or ""that way"" depending on what you're trying to do.All in all, it's a solid phone and it's good for the price. I don't make many calls, mainly just use it for texting. Once I find another phone that's a little more user friendly with more options, this phone will be my trusty back-up device!",18.0

On average the battery would last me ( on a full charge) about 3 days with about 4-5 calls a day and several text messages.These come with 2.1 froyo, although you can upgrade to 2.2 ( some may already have them) its hardly a difference. There are other ways to load most recent android versions but i would probably advise against it on these phones.Not sure how much in total these phones support for micro sd cards but i used a 32 gb one on mine and it read it fine. Since this is an entry level smartphone using a large micro sd card is probably not convenient because this has a low quality camera, you probably wont be saving much apps on this because of its android version, and other limitations.Internet function on this is basic, its not fast by any means nor would i consider it mediocre at that. For checking email, and non flash heavy websites ( with mostly just text) it will do, anything more than that for internet use and its pretty slowish.Taking video or photos from this isn't too bad as long as there is enough lightning or daylight where you take these. If you take these in the dark or places with not much lighting you won't be able to see much in the pictures ( camera has no flash either).The design is simple but if you plan on using internet somewhat heavy i wouldn't buy this considering it will lag a bit for online use.

However, I researched the company a little bit and decided that I'd give them a try because they are an American based company (for the price how could I go wrong)? This phablet has all the bells and whistle's I've come to expect from a mid range smart phone on steroids. My BLU Life 8XL has a 5.5"" HD display (267ppi): 8MP auto focus main camera (with flash) + 2MP Front Camera: 8GB internal memory: 1GB RAM: Micro SD card slot (up to 64GB): dual sim slots: 2920 mAh battery: octa-core MediaTek 6592M processor and a Mali 450 MP4 graphics processor. I was immediately impressed by how thin and light the phone is (.3 inches and 5.12 ounces respectively.) However, the phone doesn't feel flimsy or cheap. The size of the screen makes typing a breeze. I have installed a 3D launcher and enjoy watching 3D butterflies fly around on my live wallpaper. I also enjoy multitasking between applications such as Google Maps, YouTube (paired with a blue tooth speaker for max volume), Messenger and Buggle. Despite the intense demand these applications put on the GPU, I haven't experienced any lag. The battery last me 8+ hours even though I use the Wi-fi and bluetooth constantly. In my humble opinion, the BLU Life 8XL is an excellent value considering the quality of design, functionality and performance of the device.

397595,Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (WHITE) - International Stock No Warranty,Sony,408.0,5,"Looking for a small sized phone that packs a lot of power? Then this is for you. I may be in a minority but I just don't see the need for phones to be the size that they are right now. I wanted something small enough to operate with one hand and to easily fit in my pocket.My previous phone was an original Moto X and that was a great size for me so I wanted something similar, but all of the OEMs were only producing these massive devices that require two hands to operate. I mean really, how am I supposed to text and drive if I have to take both hands off the wheel? (That's a joke, NEVER text and drive.)So I did tons of research, using the phone comparison feature on sites like gsmarena.com to check the physical dimensions. The other problem was that when I did find a ""small"" phone, it usually had terrible specs. A dumbed down processor from 2 generations ago, not much memory, and often a mediocre camera.Then I found the Sony Xperia Z5 compact. This phone is small but it doesn't skimp on performance. It actually has the same processor as Google's flagship Nexus 6P, so it's blazing fast. Comes with 2GB ram (the 6P has 3GB though I believe) and 32GB built in storage which is easily expanded with an microSD card. Camera is top notch too, being from Sony who has been making cameras and camera lenses for a long time. The other nice thing is the battery life, since it has a good sized battery paired with a smaller screen, the screen actually drains the battery less than on the bigger devices. When I first bought it, I was easily getting 2 days of battery life but now that is more like a day or day and a half depending on my usage.I actually ordered it here unlocked because nobody else is carrying it in the US. When mine arrived, the menus were all in Chinese, but a quick YouTube search showed me how to switch them back to English and I was all set.I'm a big Android fan so I was weary of what kind of bloatware Sony might have installed on this. But it's really not bad at all and feels very similar to a pure android experience. There are a few little things that are different and you can uninstall any of the Sony pre-installed apps without any issue. Mine was also recently OTA'd to Marshmallow which seemed to improve performance quite a bit.Overall, I'm so happy I bought this phone. It's the perfect size if you're looking for a small Android device and has enough processing power to keep up with the latest devices. Oh, the built in fingerprint scanner in the power button is super nice too, as is the physical camera shutter button. Both of these are features I use daily. (Note: I heard that the US spec phones won't have the fingerprint scanner, so be sure to check if that matters to you.)",2.0

They had a new phone mailed to me within two days and sending my old one back was quick and painless. My old phone started showing problems within the first two days I had it, the new one I have now had for nearly a month and I haven't had any problems with it. So if you do get a phone that isn't working properly just return it! With that being said this is a really nice phone. It comes with a case and also a screen protector so you don't have to purchase either of them. The screen is a nice size and looks really good the camera is also really clear. It also comes with a pair of earbuds with a mic. All in all this is such a great product and you can't beat the price.

Never used a google phone before this one.Pros:- suitably fast- fingerprint scanner- light- screen is nice- camera is decent and the default phone app is sufficient- matte backing is nice, but easily gets smudgy- build doesn't feel cheapCons:- 2GB is not enough ram. I'm feeling like I should have gone with the 6P instead because of this, but I didn't want that large of a screen anymore...- constantly unlocking my screen because of the thumbprint scanner when grabbing for it in my pocket...which might also be a positive- the USB-C format is highly annoying, but mostly because most chargers you buy are garbage and not regulated properly, and the charging cables aren't really used except for this device right now. This means you have to buy MORE cables (and I'm sure you have 100 USB-A MicroUSB cables now) or buy an adapter, and google doesn't really provide them properly. Also, no first party car chargers that I could find that also charge another device. There are some on amazon, however.- the phone gets really hot with some apps, to the point of rebooting on long playtimes. It gets hot in general.- doesn't say Nexus 5X on the back.- CPU could be a bit more powerfulOverall, I'm satisfied for what's clearly a slight downgrade from the Note 3, but for the price, it's worth it if you're in the market for a cheap phone that isn't a ""phablet"".",2.0

If you want real protection, like an Otterbox, it definitely won't work. I use an SGM dual layer case, which is thinner than an Otterbox Defender, but it still won't work. Basically, the only cases that work with it are those that are so thin as to offer no real protection and are for decoration only, so if you are considering this product, know that you have to choose between protection and convenience. Another problem I have with it is that the blue LED is too bright. I was hoping to use it by my bedside because it sounds very convenient, but blue light is the absolute worst to have around while trying to sleep, and though it's not so noticeable on the office desk, it is quite bright in a dark room and I found it disruptive. I don't think they should have used an LED on it at all, any more than they should put one on a normal wall charger. When it's in use, your phone displays the charging icon, so the bright LED on the charger is totally unnecessary and just for show. It would be a better product without it.",4.0

If it was dark, the keyboard would sometimes light up, for about 3 seconds, and then go out, only to sometimes come back on again. You tell me. and yes, I downloaded the manual, and yes, I put all the settings on the brightest and the loudest. The symbols were sooo small (and I did fine for years with a flip phone) and they never did what they were supposed to, even when I could get lucky enough to see what one I was pushing. this phone was not for me. Maybe for you, but not for me.",1.0

It met all of my criteria. Needing to be 100% sure, I sent the link to Straight Talk to make sure there wouldn't be any issues. Ordered a SIM card. Needless to say, this phone works great!!!

We all want it NOW. I can't say enough good things about this phone.

Personally, I get at least 2 years of life from a phone before I need to upgrade. I purchased this phone brand new through amazon, in September 2015 and just last week it stopped charging. So it lasted about 7 months and I paid $120 for it. The charging port is loose and I've tried 4 different chargers. It's definitely not the chargers, it's the port on the phone. I have to hold the charging cord a certain way to get it to charge. It's extremely inconvenient so I'm going to buy a new phone. Other than that, it was a good phone while it lasted.**EDIT**After last posting this, I felt like I was way too generous with my original post. This is an awful POS phone. It's been nothing but a pain in my a**. Sorry if I sound pissed, but I am. I wasted a ton of my hard earned money on garbage. I've bought phones for a lot less money than this one that have outlasted this phone ten-fold. Oh and my charging port is so loose now, I can't charge it AT ALL.

117980,BLU Energy X 2 - With 4000 mAh Super Battery - Global GSM Unlocked Smartphone - Gold,BLU,109.99,4,"Here is a bit of extra info I haven't seen in reviews for this phone.The Lollipop 5.1 OS that comes on this phone is somewhat limited. I purchased a 64GB card to expand the storage, but to my surprise there isn't an option in the ""Storage"" settings to change the default storage device to the SD card. I thought it could have been my card, so I tested with an old 8GB one, same results. I have a 128GB card for my PC, so just for the heck of it I installed it. Even though it says it supports up to a 64GB card, the 128GB one worked perfectly, although I couldn't still change the default storage location to it. As of the time of this review, the 5.1 OS can't be upgraded to Marshmallow 6.0 or beyond yet. One of the features brought to Andoid phones is the ability to incorporate external storage, which would resolve the limitations of this phone. If this phone ever gets that update, I'll without any hesitation, purchase it again. In the meantime, I had to return the phone...I just couldn't get by with the storage limitations of 8GB. Currently I have a OnePlus One, and as great of a phone as it is, I much preferred the size, weight, screen, and layout of the Blu Energy X2.Side Note: My wife has a BLU Super Camera C phone and she loves it. I looked into her Storage settings of her phone, and sure enough, the ability to use the default storage location to an SD card was there, and that phone is only on Lollipop 5.0. If I was able to take her phone's OS, and use it on the Energy X 2, it would have resolved the biggest limitation.",9.0

Restarted and thought all was good. As I started to work on the phone it got really hot and I received a message that the UI was not longer workingI restarted several times but no luck. I have returned the phone, Amazon is great on stuff like this. I have chosen to go with the Moto X Pure Edition as it has the Snapdragon 808 vs the 810 that seems to have issues.

397125,Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (BLACK) - International Stock No Warranty,Sony,467.73,5,"Firstly, I don't often review products, and even less often am I this satisfied with a smartphone. As a consumer, I'm incredibly attentive to the small details in a product, and if the issue is annoying enough, I'll return it. Not so with the Xperia Z5 Compact (Z5c from here on). In more detail below:DISPLAY:Stunning LCD with virtually no light bleed. Colors are well saturated, and almost approach AMOLED in the level of depth. Whites are accurate, and text overall is sharp. I prefer AMOLED for the true blacks, but this is a very solid LCD. If I had one complaint, it's that the circuitry is sometimes visible in bright light behind the display.DESIGN:The phone fits in the hand very well. The sides are very easy to grip on to, and the frosted finish on the back glass is a huge improvement over the previous Xperia devices. The fingerprint scanner on the power button is extremely accurate and fast. I would have placed the volume button a bit higher than Sony did, however. I haven't tested the waterproofing, but it's a useful feature to have.PERFORMANCE:I was concerned at first about the Snapdragon 810 in the device, and heat issues, but so far, I haven't felt any extreme heating. It does definitely get warm during use, but no more than say, a Samsung Galaxy S6. It's very fast, and for gaming, the 720p display serves it well. Some users have reported performance issues or lagging through the UI, particularly when an SD card is inserted, though I've not noticed any of these. I also have had no issues with streaming Bluetooth audio.BATTERY:I don't think this device will last 2 days on a single charge, though it absolutely can get through a single day's use. I spend roughly half of my day in a low signal area, which I expect would affect this, and thus, lower the battery life. In a stronger signal environment, it would probably last longer.CAMERA:The camera is excellent. The photos are crisp, and sharp on most subjects. Low-light performance could be better, but I have no real complaints with the camera.MISC:It doesn't support Wi-Fi calling, or VoLTE on T-Mobile, though I doubt this can be helped, considering it's an international model.Overall, this is the best option if you're looking for a compact Android device. I'm certainly keeping it.",4.0

I hadn't placed any calls, texts or used internet in an hour and fifteen minutes, but the life was down.2. It takes three to six tries to get a page to open in the Mini O (Internet). This is neither efficient or convenient to my usage.3. There's only 4GB of Memory so I purchased a mini SD card of 32GB which I installed, but the phone kept interrupting me to let me know my internal memory was low, like every 30 seconds I had anything open. It's like, yes I got it the first time.4. After shutting off my phone and plugging it in to charge, it no longer turns on. I checked the battery and even tried a different charger. No dice.This thing is basically a pretty paperweight at $73.",11.0

What I did not know was that this phone did not use a data plan and, when activated, voided my unlimited data plan. Well, I used it anyway because it does have Bluetooth and I needed to stay in contact with the rest of the family. While on vacation at the beach it fell out of the car twice, in the sand once and a swim in the ocean.

From AmazonMy LG G3 finally arrived to me on April 28, when first I saw the box, noticed it did not have a security seal, I ignored this and opened it, after that noticed the phone has a little scratch on the right side of the screen, but I also ignored this, when I took the cover to put the battery in, a little screw fell down from the phone, I took it and screw it again (it could be a bad factory assembling), after that, I turned it on and noticed the screen was not the one that was described in the box neither in the Amazon offer, the screen should have Quad-HD resolution and this one had a Full-HD resolution, so I tried the camera, this step makes me think that parts were taken from this phone, the camera was terrible, even I compared it to the same device I bought one month earlier and I was right, it was a lot of difference, but the main difference were the speed, so I downloaded and application (CPUZ) that analyzes the device and shows the hardware that it is inside, I got surprised when I saw that the processor was not the Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 running at 2.5Ghz described in the box¸ it was an ARMv7 running at 1.3Ghz, the Ram memory offered was 3 GB, this Phone came with 2GB, my conclusion was that this purchase was a hustle, taking advantage on the article saying that it does not have warranty they change your phone for a cheaper one, it is a shame that hustlers use this platform to “work” like this, I got very disappointed because it was a gift for my wife, hope you could take down this hustlers and in the possibilities help me with my wife's gift because here in Venezuela it is not allowed to use more than 300$ a year, and mine were spent in this failed purchase.

238908,"LG Xpression 2, Blue Unlocked (No Warranty)",LG,43.9,2,"* UPDATE * - Amazon has made things right! Always buy items ""Fulfilled By Amazon""! They will take care of you. BUYER BEWARE - This is not simply a NEW unlocked LG phone...this is an unlocked AT&T LG phone! The AT&T logo is right on the case and you will find out it is AT&T through and through as you navigate pages. I am going to discuss with Amazon if the description isn't fully truthful. New? Not so sure. Box taped up before then tape ripped off. No user's manual. Sticker slapped over technical info pre-printed on box. Now on to the phone - switched from Verizon to Consumer Cellular. I was told by seller and CC that I might lose higher functions. Functions I lost were internet access and mobile email. I can live without. . Still would have liked seeing factory fresh packaging when NEW. Take note of what I did not. I was used to a 5 line keypad and did not realize. This is a 4 line phone. I did not pay close enough attention. This has no dedicated number line. Numbers on this phone are an ""ALT +"" function. I miss the number line. Numbers are in a dark blue field on the shared keys. Impossible to see in lower light. Keypad backlighting fades out quickly. Have not yet found a setting to fix this. Also, you had better be a fast dialer...lack of input of more than a few seconds will black out the display. Yes, I know...only $50. But it is $50 I would like to have back to buy a better phone. Threw away all the packaging so return is not an option. Porting my number from Verizon to CC no problem. My generous Consumer Cellular Plan is $17.50/mo. with no contract. They simply did not offer a keypad phone in their lineup. If you can live without the features I mentioned by going to anyone but AT&T, go for it. If I could get I would give the phone itself a ""C-"" grade. Thanks, Todd",2.0
241038,"Microsoft Lumia 950 XL RM-1085 32GB Black, Single Sim, 5.7"", 20MP, 3GB Ram, Unlocked International Model, No Warranty",Microsoft,328.41,4,"Phone Purchased from Mobile Front. Understand that this is an international version of the phone. Mine is a single SIM. The phone will boot up into a foreign language. Don't panic you can simply scroll through the listed languages until you find the one you want, English(American) for me. The power supply/charger supplied in the box is for foreign plug ins, but Mobile Front supplies an adapter. They do not however supply any directions, so it helps to know that the plug has a plastic prong that can be moved. It has to be moved out a little bit to work with the us power adapter, which was not clear at first.The phone itself is pretty snazzy, but coming from a Lumia 1520, which is an incredible phone, i was a little underwhelmed. The 1520 feels like a solid well crafted device. The 950 XL a little less so, but it is still a really decent phone. The Windows Hello unlock is frustrating to set up, but very cool once you do. The phone is very zippy and seems pretty powerful. It is substantially faster then the 1520. The biggest plus to this phone is the Windows 10 Mobile, which is HANDS DOWN the best and easiest to use phone OS. If Microsoft persuades companies to develop more apps for the platform it will be unbeatable. It still has MANY of the big important apps. Bottom line - Good phone, Good Price!",3.0

Its easy enough to learn your way around- it operates really efficiently in terms of browsing- It plays media wonderfully,its my new favNot so good points:- the body of the phone will need protecting from falls and scratches as the screen and casing both scratch easily.- the battery life isn't long lasting. some days i need to recharge 2 - 3 times depending on usage.

Do you use your phone as an alarm for work and need it to function properly? If the answer is yes then buy a different phone. This phone lasted 12 hours before it started to have problems. Before I even got service to it the screen started developing cracks in the glass. What caused it? My only guess is aliens snuck into my apartment, took it off my desk and chiseled alien codes into the screen. I've owned the phone for 4 months and it freezes 20-25 times a day. The phone also gets stuck in constant reboot cycles seemingly at random just to freeze again after about the 7th reboot. Could the alien code and the freezing/reboots be related? Could the aliens be trying to communicate with humans but I'm too stupid to realize their code? These could be explanations for the problems I have each day with this phone. It could also be that the phone is just a $170 Cleveland steamer that amazon delivered to my door. I would just assume I got a lemon but there are 3 others at my office that have blu phones and they all have the same issues minus the aliens chiseling the secrets of the universe into their screens.

She opened it, played with it for about 20 minutes before the screen began to blink and stop responding to any touch on the screen or the button. Sent it back, at my own expense, and had a new one sent out. They did send an extra battery to sort of reimburse me for the shipping costs, which was good because the battery that was on the second watch when it got here exploded shortly after being turned on, but thankfully didn't damage the watch. The description for the item is a little unclear. This doesn't work WITH your smart phone, it IS a smart phone. It needs it's own sim card to be able to use all the functions, My friend almost had me send it back again because the touch screen isn't very sensitive at all.

An mp3 watch seems like the perfect solution (yes, an mp3 player might be simpler. However I don't always have pockets, I hate arm bands, and I hate clipping things to my clothing. I know, first world problems). An option for communicating in case of emergencies might also be nice, so an mp3 watch it is. So all I'm really looking for is an mp3 player that's easy to wear, with a time function and possibly texting in a pinch, not a device to be my new best friend.I first tried a GT08, which seemed to work nicely but it bothered me when I noticed I had paid twice as much as I should have (the problem with these Chinese knock-offs is the same product is available from different sellers at vastly different price points). Plus I really disliked the ""nucleus"" menu style, so thought I'd try a different model.There was a lot to like about the CNPGD. Right out of the box, the silver metal finish looks very high quality and the band is much nicer than the GT08, very supple and comfortable. The menus are much cleaner and easier to navigate, having only 4 rather than 8 (mostly useless) options per screen. It let me transfer all my music into the required ""my music"" folder (something I suspect all these watches have in common to use the music player from your SD card) via PC, much more painless than the GT08 that made me hand select each song from the watch screen individually to move (note: I had to reboot the watch for it to find them, a minor inconvenience since the boot sequence is very quick).However, the love affair ended instantly when I realized to my dismay there was no shuffle option to be found anywhere for the player. I really wish if this isn't to be a standard feature that it would be mentioned in the item description. Who wants to listen to their playlist straight through in alphabetical order? Stupidest omission on an mp3 player ever.Another maybe not so small complaint is there seems to be no way to change the truly ugly watch face -- tapping the screen (which the GT08 required) did nothing, and I couldn't find any theme settings anywhere (not like there are a ton of places to look).So the search continues. Thank goodness for Amazon's painless return process, however I'm now out $12 in return shipping fees. If my third attempt is a bust, I may have to start considering something in a much higher price range (although from what reviews I've read on a few products, that's not necessarily a guarantee of quality either).",1.0

252481,Motorola Moto G LTE- Factory Unlocked US Warranty (Black),,108.0,4,"I picked this phone up to replace my Nokia Lumia 635 on Cricket. What a difference! This phone is much more rugged, has a faster processor and more RAM. 8GB of internal storage is pretty small by today's standards, but by adding a 64GB microSD card, it's mostly a non-issue. It will play most current games on Google Play at low or medium settings; don't expect it to play any recent titles on high or ultra settings. Phone only lags occasionally, typically when there is lots of Java running.For the price, there is no better mid-level phone out there. It's also been nice to get back to Android after trying out Windows phone for a year.My reduction to 4-stars may be due to my provider or perhaps a little false advertising. On Cricket Wireless, this phone will only attain data speeds of HSPA+ (H+). I have brought it to a Cricket store and worked with Cricket tech support, they are not able to get it to 4G speeds no matter what they do. Now the difference between H+ (3G+) and 4G is mostly negligible, but I bought this phone under the impression that it would do 4G/LTE speeds on the Cricket (AT&T) network. Apparently not. Maybe due to the fact that this is the Universal model, not the US model? This is my only complaint. If anyone knows how to get it to reach 4G speeds on Cricket, I'm all ears.",1.0

Well it was acting like it was gonna do it, but then instead it just died.Windows Mobile kind of lame compared to Android and IOS (iPhone). I mean Windows Mobile almost always runs smooth on any phone which is good; however the reason why is because it is a simple little blocks on the screen (tiles), and just a lite of apps. It's not customize able at all compared to Android, and the app selection is also not that great.If i didn't buy a Lumia 640 for $40, I would have exchanged it and tried it again, maybe a blue colored phone or yellow. I like the Blu phones they are not bad for the price and most of them are 2 sim phones. Not sure why this thing died just trying to hard reset it, that was kind of a surprise.

My primary complaint is not with the phone itself but with the loaded AT&T software geared at data usage and extra purchases.

I spent more than I wanted to on a phone, but this phone had the BEST reviews from any website! I seriously looked all over and this came back the top rated phone every time, plus everyone said that the phone was user friendly and it is. I thought the blue would be brighter or deeper, but it's just an ordinary blue, similar to sky blue, but just a touch darker. The red one is much more attractive, but I didn't want to spend the additional $50.00, so I stuck with the blue. The battery life, I can't comment on, since I haven't used the phone that much, but it's the same size battery as the one in my old LG and that phone lasts for at least three hours, sometimes four, so I'm not expecting any issues with that. This phone CAN be used with or without a SIM card. Hope this was helpful.Update: 10/20/11I returned the phones, because we went with a different carrier and the phones were not compatible with that network. However, HP Electronics is a WONDERFUL company and this return has nothing to do with their products or service. In fact, they let me return the phones AFTER the 30days and gave me a FULL refund. It is rare to find a company with such concern for the happiness of their customers. Already looking into purchasing other items from them again. Love love love this company! They took good care of me and I could not be happier. I highly recommend them and can not say enough good things about them! Shop with confidence people, these people will treat you right!

My mom decided she wants to switch from at&t to Verizon in 3 months and so i didn't want to buy an extremely expensive phone and then just have to give it up and get a different phone for Verizon. No, that would have been wasted money. So I found this phone and went to the refurbished section. I found one that was $33.00 plus $4.00 in shipping. and considering originally if i wanted this phone to be new, i would have had to pay $70.00 that is a great deal to buy a $33.00 phone. Especially since I am only 14 and don't have much money. My mom got an email saying the phone had been shipped, and the estimate arrival date was two weeks, :( two days later a box delivered from amazon arrived, MY PHONE HAD COME! to start you can set a signature and the pic quality is amazing. My fav color is blue and that is the color of the phone. I have dropped it 3 times and it hasn't gotten a single scratch!!! AMAZING. The keyboard slides easily and is very easy to text on. This phone has gotten some bad reviews about how terrible the touch screen is, but if you go to the volume changing buttons on the side and click at the top on the button that says touchtone, and then set the volume to silent, then the touchscreen is amazing. and it works amazingly.

I've never used anything this fast (only thing that might beat it is the Pixel, but I have yet to try that out).Screen: perfect for my uses.

I'm glad I did because the phone looks brand new with no cosmetic imperfections. I was actually confused as to whether it is refurbished or new; it was even wrapped up like a new device. However, I don't know if all the phones they sell are in this condition. According to BuySPRY, the phone was refurbished by Google - and it shows.I purchased this phone to replace my weathered Nexus 5. One thing I did notice was the difference in color reproduction between the two phones' panels, white in particular. The whites on my old Nexus panel are brighter and ""more white"". The whites on the refurb panel are like an egg shell white. This was not a deal breaker for me since it's a natural white, but it was worth noting.Anyway, I am very satisfied with my purchase and would recommend buying from here if you're in the market for a Nexus 5.",0.0

I did a lot of research to ensure this model would work best on their network. It appears that most/ (maybe all) GSM phones with work world-wide on other GSM networks. However, from my research, it seems as though not every GSM phone will with perform as well as the ""branded"" models that are designed for use on their networks. This appears to especially hold true for what data speed you can potentially connect with i.e., 3G maximum or 4G LTE service.I ordered a new phone and that is exactly what I got. It still had the protective film over all the ports, etc. and the phone clock only had a few minutes of QC test-time on it. It came with a battery, wall charger, ear-buds and instructions. I did have to go to the AT&T store to have them install a micro-SIM because my old phone used the mini-SIM so I could not simply swap it out between the two phones.Overall this a very nice high-end phone. Fast, with a crisp & clear screen. Seems to be working fine on my network and it connects to the LTE signals when I'm in range of those cell towers.",9.0

Well, there aren`t in the package that I have received.What attracted me in the first place was the titanium look, and in this aspect I am more than pleased. Not only it looks excellent, but the texture of the back of the phone doesn`t show fingerprints. The sound is best I have had in any phone. The cameras are decent.What I appreciate is that the language settings were set for my location and the charger came with an appropriate adapter.Update 29 January 2016: after five months in use the screen started losing responsiveness; the power button is also non responsive, unless pressed with excessive force; there are numerous software glitches.

I am very pleased with the delivery. It was really fast.Packed in good manner. Battery was 70% charged, started without any problem. This is unlocked model and I used AT&T SIM to it. It worked without any problem.It is only 1 day since I am using it so it is too early to give any comments. So far it is very good. I haven't faced any problems with it.Very light weight compared to existing windows phone 7 HTC HD7.Call voice quality is not that good but with this cost it is acceptable.UPDATE: AT&T Data plan is not working with this phone. I spoke to AT&T customer service and even if they registered this Phone's IMEI number in the account, Data Communication is still not working. I guess I just wasted the money on this 'Cananda' based phone. Once I used Nokia E72 unlocked phone with AT&T, and it worked like charm. I wish I could have the same Nokia phone handy.UPDATE 8/22/2013: After reviewing an user comment, I realized that I gave wrong feedback. Changing 4 star to 2 Star. Actually delivery, packaging all matters when actual product function and behave as per expectation which it did not.",5.0

I really had a hard time returning it as I have no idea when they will be back in stock.

There are a few disappointments that I haven't figured out yet- like my cars can no longer read my phone book or read my text messages to me. So now when I'm driving, if I don't know a number I can't make a call. I miss knowing what texts were coming in and being able to respond through the voice features in my car. The camera is hit or miss. I find I have a lot more disappointing, blurry photos with this camera than with my Nokia Lumia. Also, despite all the settings available to manipulate the camera, I find that I'm just not able to get decent shots most of the time like I could on my Lumia. There are some fun Instagram like filters built into the editing software but a better quality picture to start with would be nice.

The phone is sturdy, not a smart phone. Simple. The phone is unlocked, if your not sure what a unlocked phone means go to You Tube, lots of great tutorials, you can use just about any carrier you choose, the SIM card slot is standard size, I used a micro SIM card, worked fine. It has a dual SIM card slot, the 2nd slot is for memory card, the instructions for the phone are very simple, not detailed. I had to go to You tube to figure out how to use speaker, down load music, and how to use some of other features, no big deal. The Big Name Cell Companies may not sell you a SIM Card, they want you in a contract, and they won't tell you, most of them use same towers, there are cell phone companies that are charging 25.00/ mon. Unlimited talk, and text, and 30.00/ mon, unlimited talk, text, and internet net use, internet not unlimited, but like I said this is not a smart phone, so you more than likely won't use much.

The small compact size is perfect for me and I don't mind the thickness, I assume it's thicker than most to put that bigger battery in. I thought it would be hard to go small since I'm coming from the iPhone 6 Plus, but wasn't bad at all in my opinion. This is actually the first android phone that I can say I won't be going back to my iPhone. I get about 1 1/2 days of battery life at moderate use. so far my screen on time averages 4 hours, best was 4 hours 45 minutes. My last android phone was the 2015 moto x pure and that battery life was horrible along with others I have owned, nexus 5x, Htc one m7, m8, m9, nexus 5, and so on which always made me go back to my iPhone along with other reasons. I am in the United States and with At&t and can confirm LTE works perfectly. No issues at all. Also I didn't have to manually put in the APN for mms or Internet to work, u just make sure u have wifi connected and then go to settings, then more, then scroll down and hit internet settings. Hit download and it will automatically download the correct settings for your carrier, make sure your carrier sim is installed. The camera is good enough for me, I'm no professional photographer so I just leave it in superior auto mode and it takes good pics in my opinion. I can confirm the phone back does get a little warm during some situations. First one was downloading all my apps from the play store at the same time. 2nd is using hangouts for video calls, other than that it has been fine. The heat it did get did not burn my hand and was still comfortable to hold and use. I did get the DP glass screen protector which I put on all my phones and I like it. I'm not a case kind of guy so waiting on my dbrand skin. I did get the white version and I have not had any screen issues or my on screen buttons not working on my bed. I assume others just got a defective unit. I got usb cord, earbuds, and a international plug in the box. Just a side not I only have one hand and am super happy that a company actually makes a one handed device with great specs. Most android phones I've had one handed use was very difficult if not impossible but had no choice if wanted top specs, so thank you Sony for high end specs in a compact size.",2.0

308922,"Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679",Samsung,119.99,2,"FYI: I have had this phone for less than 1 week.I havent been totally displeased with this phone (but I cant bring myself to give it 3 stars). It is quick, the screen has pretty crisp images/good resolution and colors (depending on what you are used to), the camera is good (not great), and the Samsung interface is better than vanilla Android in my opinion (adding shortcuts/widgets to the homescreen for example). However, this phone has been freezing a LOT (also..the pull down notification bar often wont stick/stay down, it just goes back up, the call volume could be a little louder, and the signal ability seems slightly weaker than other phones). Basically, it freezes once or twice with every 20 minutes (straight) of use. And it was like that even when I barely had any apps downloaded onto it. To make matters worse, it doesnt just pick up where it left off after a few minutes of me waiting...it concludes by restarting itself! This is usually not a big deal but I have worked on school papers via phone before and I would hate for it to shut down during a time like that. Such an issue just doesnt make the phone feel dependable. Im considering returning this phone.If it matters to you...the freeze ups are not during gaming or watching movies...they are during simpler things like clicking on something (or just the Back button) within the first 1 or 2 screens of an app. Neither Home nor Back work. Not even volume (oh, that freezes up too by the way...when there is no other freezing going on.) The only button that works is the lock screen/power button but it only provides the on/off screen, not any actual locking or powering down during the freeze.Tiny gripe: I wish there was some other way to turnt he screen on other than just by the somewhat stiff, high-up button on the right-hand side. Its not a convenient spare fo the moment location. The phone is a *little* awkward to hold/not narrow enough and I dont have short fingers. The plus of the power/lock button being high is carefree placement in a car mount, but its just high up enough to not be a comfy location. The volume button is a little lower and no problem.Tethering - at least as is - does not work, but I dont fault the phone for that (but I wanted to let you know what to expect). I am quite sure it is due to T-Mobile now charging (monthly add-on) for Wifi and USB tethering. I havent had any problems with bluetooth connectivity.",2.0

In Geekbench 3, the J5 scored 459 in the single core test and 1,343 in the multicore test, putting it just behind the Moto G on our budget leaderboard. That said, Samsung's Android 5.1.1-based TouchWiz interface still feels relatively smooth and responsive, and apps don't take an age to open either. The Moto G proved quicker at loading games, but web browsing was more or less a level playing field, as evidenced by the J5's Peacekeeper score of 634, which is only around 100 points short of the Moto G. Scrolling was a little jerky in places, and browsing could be rather stop-start when pages were still loading, but otherwise surfing the web was pretty hassle free.",2.0

231980,LG Nexus 5X Unlocked Smartphone - White 32GB (U.S. Warranty),LG,399.0,5,"I upgraded/downgraded from a Nexus 6. The Nexus 6 certainly has a slightly better screen, speakers, and more ram, but it's also way heavier, and feels to big in my pocket. I wanted to go back to having a smaller phone that still had stock Android. I have read on some tech sites they experienced occasional lag, but I can honestly say I have not experienced that at all. That may be because I pretty just use the basic stock Android apps. This phone is super fast, and best of all the finger sensor on the back is easily the best I've ever used. I had an iPhone 6 and this seems to unlock much faster. With the iPhone you had to first pretty the button to get the screen to come on, and then hold your finger over the sensor. With the back sensor on the 5X you simple put whichever finger you registered (you can register multiple fingers by the way) and the screen will unlock right away. Once you get used to it you will not want to go back.Then we have the other elephant in the room which is the USB C connector. I've seen people say that this is just a ploy to get people to get new cables. That is simply not true. USB C is the next evolution in USB technology. The has rapid charging which is not to be confused with quick charging on certain other Android phones. USB C can handle more amps at a time so your phone will charge faster then normal and without heating up like quick charging does for example with the Nexus 6. Of course there is the fact that it's dual sided so you can't put it in the wrong way. I know it sounds silly and even stupid, but it's one of those tiny things that after awhile you won't want to go back. That seems to be this phone in a nutshell. Full of small tiny improvements that make a great package. You won't want to go back to whatever you had before.",3.0

271690,Nokia Lumia 900 16GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Windows 7.5 Smartphone w/ 8MP Camera - White,Nokia,150.0,5,"I purchased this phone after carefully researching my next phone purchase. I was tired of Boost and Virgin Mobile and the terrible service they provide and their watered down phones. Don't believe anyone who tells you the phones manufactured for these prepaid services are the same ones that are released to contract carriers. I had the EVO on Virgin Mobile and Samsung Galaxy on Boost and they were nothing like the same phones given to my friends from contract carriers. You get what you paid for.After receiving this phone I can truly say it is one of the best purchases I have ever made. I am as left leaning liberal as they come and it pains me to give the thumbs up to a major corporation, but the fact of the matter is that Nokia is a superior company to Samsung and HTC and AT&T invented the phone and has the largest 4G network. So when combined these two companies have created an untouchable product. This is my first windows phone and I can say that the OS is unbelievable. People choose Apple and Android b/c they are inherent Microsoft haters. However Microsoft powers the world whether they like it or not. This phone works smooth and the screen and looks are top notch. It never hangs or needs rebooting and the features actually work the first time you click them. The back button on Android is a joke there is no telling where it is taking you. When you press the back button on this phone, you go back to the previous screen. Isn't that a notion??? The camera is not the best in the world even though it is a name brand camera, but for goodness sakes it is a phone - who cares. I have also read the reviews that say the phone is ""locked"" to AT&T and this is not true. Yes it says AT&T on it but it works on any GSM network. Not too mention, I put it on AT&T's Go Phone prepaid plan so I am getting 4G LTE unlimited talk and text for $60 per month, and they sell the prepaid cards at a million stores and gas stations and you can setup your account online and AT&T even takes e-checks. I am done with the empty Android promises, locking phones, freezing screens, and inferior battery life that the Boost and Virgin Mobile phones provide. I don't even have to charge the phone every day and I talk over 5000 minutes per month. I will admit there are some apps like Mapquest and Google Maps that I miss from my android phone and AT&T charges for their navigation service. I will also admit the screen is no where near as brilliant as an I Phone or Galaxy or even the upper end Nokia. But I will gladly trade that for a phone that works everywhere and that does not freeze every five minutes. And I have invested $200 in the phone and I am paying $720 a year for 4G service on a great network and I don't have a contract and I can still sell this phone on Amazon a year from now for $100 or $150. Compare that with spending $500 or more and having a contract and spending $100 per month for unlimited. There is no comparison. I do regret I could not afford the Lumia 928 but for what I am getting I am grateful.",1.0

The first day I considered returning it after the first 2 charges it needed - BUT THEN, as I looked into the running processes (and the Axon task manager) killed the unwanted apps and suddenly- THE BATTERY LASTED MUCH LONGER and the phone was MUCH COOLER. I will list the pros and cons.Pro:1. The size is large enough but not too large.2. The battery laats a full day (plus some)3. Clearest call quality I have used (oneplus,iPhone,galaxy)4. The antennas are amazing! (Family trip we had 1 fire phone, 2/iphones 1 blackberry- the bb had lte voice only- the others 1 bar 2 g and Axon 3 bars lte voice +data = my calls didn't drop like everyone else)5. Feels very well built.6. Zte passport replacement (a feature I usually buy from others - free with Axon)7. BEST SOUND REPRODUCTION I have experienced on a phone.8.Included earbuds are the best I have gotten bundled with a music product.9.4GB RAM makes this blazing FAST.Cons:1.Runs very hot the first day of use. (ZTE should be clear on this in info)2. Battery was also dismal on first day of use (another point ZTE forgot to mention)3.Not as customizable as I would hope. (Software update could change that)4.Only 32 GB (non expandable) being the only option. (Being cloud based it isn't a deal breaker but other choices would have been great) Overall, I can recommend this phone without reservation. Zte has made a QUALITY PRODUCT (designed in USA).",47.0

274697,Nokia Lumia 920 32GB Unlocked GSM Windows 8 Smartphone w/ Carl-Zeiss Optics Camera - White,,99.99,4,"Really Really nice phone. Fast, responsive, you name it. Works on T-mobile, and I do believe that it adapts to LTE because the web pages load much faster than my previous phone that just had the 4G and I see H+ in the corner of the navigation bar. Very nice display, vibrant and crisp.After owning this unit for 2 weeks, I will never go back to Android based phones. This phone comes with Windows 8 but with 4 updates you'll have the full 8.1 package. Windows 8.1 has a simple and clean layout, simply said it looks professional whereas Android has the kids feel to it with garbage cluttered all over the place. Sure you have some limitation to customization in comparison but there are enough options to satisfy most. I really really like the Office programs, Word, Onenote, Powerpoint, ExcelBattery lasts me 2 full days, probably can squeeze by with 3 by turning it off at night, with heavy texting and some web page reading as well as email checking on the commute to/from work. So to a heavy user with social media and music playing, there's no reason that that unit wouldn't last you all day long.My only negatives. the sound is not as loud whether it be alerts or music playing. You'd have a hard time hearing alerts given that the phone is your pocket say at a grocery store unless it's set on max. The second and probably most important is this Gorilla Glass the manufacturer speaks off because I don't see it, what I do is is 2 small scratches that have already appeared. How? when the unit's been either in a separate pocket away from things or on the top of my desk. So that tells me that it had to have been from the fingers and hence it would be in your interest in purchasing a protective film because if it scratched this easily,what will happen if you put it in your backpack or purse alongside other items....yea",0.0

Many seniors have difficulty hearing and my mother could not hear it ""ring"" with any of the offered tones. I was able to solve that by downloading other ring tones using Zedge that had better volume than those offered with this phone.The case is totally black (looks gray in photo) and the keys on the bottom to go back, etc are very small & virtually impossible to see if you have impaired vision.The phone is very small and is clumsy for hands with arthritisNo hard or gel case available for protection, only those pouches. If you have arthritic hands it is difficult to get it out of the pouch to answer a call before it stops ringing. Those cases do not offer much protection and no other case will fit on the phones.The 5Star is there for emergency assistance, however, if you fall & have it in your hand chances are it's gonna break when you fall or you may be so injured that you cannot get it out of the pouch to push that button. I realize that it will dial automatically IF it senses a fall, I presume that only works if you do have it in your hand and it doesn't break in the fall.I wish I had been able to see and examine it before my mother bought it, very disappointed in the overall design. I think she regrets the purchase also.If you are a senior and want a ""smart phone"" there are better options & you can get 5Star without it. I would not recommend this to anyone.",33.0

260182,Nokia 220 RM-971 Unlocked Cell Phone with 2MP Camera (Black),Nokia,174.1,2,"I love the candy bar phones. I want something simple and durable in a phone and I thought this would be an upgrade from my last phone. I purchased a 16gb memory card to compliment it for music mostly. I don't have a data plan so texting and calling were my main necessities. After about 50 texts I have to delete them because there is no room to receive more...and that's with 15gb free on the memory card. Messages cannot be saved to memory card so you are stuck with saving to the small phone memory. Also, even though I have contacts in there, many of them just don't show up in my address book. It's extremely odd, because there is no rhyme or reason to whose information will show and whose won't. The people's numbers who have ""disappeared"" are still somewhere in the phone's memory because when they call or text me, their name will show up, but I just cannot access the information if I need their phone number. I like the music player and the FM radio, it comes with a flashlight which is cool. I have yet to set up the VPN to receive MMS and such, but I'm not sure I'm going to yet because it is pretty ridiculous that these basic functions of saving contacts and SMS messages is as sub par as it is. If I am missing something, please let me know, but I see no way of being able to save your contacts or messages to an insertable memory card, and you are stuck then with the crappy memory of the phone",11.0

Voice quality is good, pictures are good, display is high-quality (and screen is fairly big), and sound is good through headphones. OS works about as well as you can expect, and, with the 64G SD card I added, I can store whatever I want, including all my music. You should be aware that it's getting harder to store apps on a memory card, though, and the limited onboard storage of the BLU means that it's possible you could run out of room.The dual sim is also great for those traveling overseas.Be clear that this is nothing close to iPhone quality. I'm happy with the picture quality, but I've photographed the same scene at the same time as a friend has done it with her iPhone, and the quality difference is pretty clear (the extra $400-500 for the iPhone does buy you something). Also, this phone doesn't do too well with wi fi, so for those who are trying to save data, that may be an issue. I try to use wifi whenever I can, but have learned that sometimes it just won't work (in places where I know the wi fi signal is fine). But, if you want to save money and are willing to accept some compromises, this is a good buy. Even used iPhones often cost more, and with the crappy storage they often have, you're SOL unless you want to pay the outrageous prices for for their stupid proprietary storage cards. And, for those trying to pinch pennies, this comes with a case and screen protector, so you don't have to spring for those. The case is no OtterBox, but it's fine for moderate abuse.One other caution--if you store your phone in your pocket, and you don't have very big pockets, you're going to have to find another storage option. I'm an average-sized male, and even for me, if I sit on the ground, I can feel the thing poking up into my thigh.",3.0

Just wish it had more onboard memory because even with a huge SD card you can still only put a few apps on it because it still needs internal memory to run the apps and most of the preinstalled google apps plus the huge memory sucker Facebook App won't let you install on SD card. And you can't uninstall most of Googles Apps. By the time every single app updates after you setup your phone there isn't much left for your own apps.

For me, since its my first smartphone, there was a bit of a learning curve and I think that I really only use about 2% of the phone's capability but I definitely use more of those smart capabilities than I did at first! I can hear my callers very well, it takes excellent pictures -- too many extra apps on it that I don't use -- and the touchscreen keyboard is very good.

49474,"Apple iPhone 5s AT&T Cellphone, 16GB, Silver",Apple,139.95,3,"Granted, this is an older model, but I prefer to hold at least the semblance of a phone next to my ear than a wanna be iPad (iPhone 6 and others). The format was easy to learn: I also use Mac computers. I like the touch screen. Would prefer NOT to have the Apple watch icon, which so far I fail to find how to remove.I don't harbor hoards of pictures, but do use the phone for my Kindle books (300+) and Solfeggio music (lots again) and the 16GB seems to be adequate for my needs. Basically, the phone is more for business than personal. It is my first experience with texting and have to admit, I have become a fan. Quick. To the point. Get 'er done. Important in our no nonsense little time work world.IMPORTANT TO KNOW: my account with AT&T is a monthly No Contract. When I asked about a contract, the sales rep told me because this is considered a ""third party"" phone, I was not eligible for a monthly contract. That requires buying your phone from an AT&T distributor or directly from them. For me this was fine. I got a great deal with more data time than a contract arrangement and my monthly is less than $50.Another Point to Ponder: No one really tells you that with this phone (maybe others?) every month it is best to completely shut it down to reboot. After all, it is a computer. I found this out when I lost capability to enter addresses into my contacts. A friend who had used the i5s alerted me to the reboot feature. Doing this, I have not had any further problems, mechanically.CON: that in a way all Apple products are intrusive into our life by recording and keeping a digital record of EVERYTHING you do on the phone: calls, texts, web sites. I understand Android does the same, but not as intrusive as Apple. I don't like this aspect at all. Be aware.PRODUCT was delivered per my special request on time. Product not exactly as described by seller and no instruction guide included. Because of some other customer service issues, I find it difficult to recommend the third party seller.",

I installed a few apps, I was installing a Wikipedia App, which is quite large, as it was installing, it said insufficient space, and from then on, anything i want to add additionally it says memory not enough, i tried removing apps and installing new ones, but somehow it kept the memory that was using to install the Wikepedia as dormant..and I cannot install pretty much anything new.. I will need to re-boot to factory settings and see if it fixes it, but that means i have to re-install everything again.. will see what happens after i do that.. overall a great phone, but the memory leak part was kinda annoying for me.. I'm a little techy guy and hopefully the erase all and install will fix it.. but a person without tech knowledge will just get their phone stuck.. I'm surprised there is a memory leak, reading online i found other users experience the same issue.. hmm... I'm happy with the purchase, but just i have to do extra work..... if it didn't have the memory leak, i would rate it 5 stars.. but that is a major no no... so yah my initial rating was 3 stars for one key main issue that should be addressed by motorola... on the testing department.--ok I fixed the memory leak issue, and it is now working great... I had to basically wipe out my info and re-install my apps... and now it works great.. 5 stars..i would say the problem occurred cause i was probably installing too many apps at once, and also upgrading the OS (i think this upgrading of the OS was what caused it, as it was also installing other apps at the time)... so this somehow put into a freezing mode and would not release my memory... now it all is good, I don't know why this happened, but anyhow its a great phone... I think this would of probably happen to any phone, as it is based on the OS is what I think and not on the hardware itself.. anyways, so I'm changing my mind and upgrading the rating to 5 stars.. =) Great Phone.. Great size, back cover feel is awesome on the hand... like some soft powder it feels like... I'm actually carrying a good size phone, and not a huge one.. like lots of people.. hehe :)One thing I would say that needs improvement.. I dropped my phone once, and have little scratches.. the hard like material on the front sides to the sides of the screen, i believe there should be a slightly softer material, like the back side of the cover material, this will make it more fall resistant.. and scratch resistant to accidental drops.. but overall a great phone... very happy with it..",0.0

Even bigger than the iPhone 6s PLUS!!! It's size makes it rather inconvenient as it can't fit in anything. The camera has surprisingly low quality, considering the Polaroid brand is commonly a camera manufacturer. I had the phone for about 4 months before I bumped it on a corner and the whole screen became pixelated. From then on, the screen had all these little lines across it that wouldn't disappear. I had the phone for a total of 7 months before I dropped it on the sidewalk and the phone wouldn't even turn on again. I understand that phones do break - they can't last forever. But this phone is so large that it's hard to keep a hold of it, and the first incident definitely shouldn't have caused permanent internal screen damage. This phone is extremely brittle.

210024,LG A275 Black Unlocked GSM Dual SIM QuadBand Cell Phone - International Version - No Warranty,LG,50.5,4,"Item stated before I added to cart, that item was from Wireless Experts fulfilled by Amazon. NOTE -- if you click on item today you will see different seller. Click on it a few hours later and seller will be different again. I have NO IDEA what Amazon is doing. I've seen this on other items that Amazon sells.There were previous reviews about BOTH the phone and the manual being in a language thatwas not understandable. Mine came in Spanish. Seller not honest in description of item. See below howto ENGLISH settings.So far, 2 days, I am pleased with the phone. I installed a global SIM from company called""Roam Simple"" and tested texting and making calls FROM USA; it connected to T-Mobile.Works well. I've not used it outside USA yet. Getting connection and call quality will varyin the EU based on country, city, etc. (I have used other phones in the EU.)Call quality / clarity: In US - fine. (my SIM connected to T-mobile in USA.)DUAL SIM ... nice feature ... use one in your country with cheap in country rates. Other SIM use it for yourinternational travel global SIM.Volume fine. (in some previous reviews people mentioned issues. )FM radio - works OK. (NOTE - adjust volume up and down using the center button.)Texting - no full qwerty keyboard so it is texting as it was about 6 years ago on most phones.World Clock, Alarms, Stopwatch, CalculatorBattery: Mine came with an LG 950mH .. great! is still showing fully charged.Torch (Flashlight) .. nice feature. Press center button in UP direction to turn on and off.Phone is great size for traveling.No WEB / internet access with this model. I was not expecting it.Up to 250 contacts.MAKING CALLS and SIM: If you buy a country specific (Argentina) or region (EU) SIM then you may notget service when the phone is in the USA. I bought global SIM for $29. Check with your SIM provider BEFORE buying.NOT ENGLISH: Box was in English, I was hopeful manual would be. It was not - it was in Spanish.I spent about 3 hours looking for a manual. I found full ENGLISH USER GUIDE on the LG Australiaweb site. Search the LG site for A190. The model appears to be the same as the A275 that was soldto Spanish and Portuguese (Brazil) countries. (the A275 manual not English is on the LG Brazil site).ELECTRIC POWER: The power supply had a USA plug. I cannot tell if it is DUAL VOLTAGE phone chargerallowing it to be plugged into non USA 220V power outlets with just a conversion plug. I will be using aPOWER CONVERTER (search Amazon for 220V to 120V converters). You may need a converter thanactually is a transformer - converting power down to 120v.COVERSome people talked about cover problems. Gently press down on back cover and gently slide down SLIGHTLY - about an1/8 of an inch. Then from the back, where cover should be extended past end of the phone, lift up the cover.INSTALL BATTERY. If you ever did this on any phone, this should be simple. (NOTE - SIM slots are under the battery.)COVER - back on: DO NOT SLIDE COVER UP. Start with placing cover back on to position whereyou popped it up. THEN slide it up the 1/8 of an inch to lock it in place.CHARGE THE BATTERYThe power input for the cord is under a rubber cover on the LEFT side. It only OPENS on way. BE CAREFUL.Turn phone on its side. With the power cover appearing to your left, gently pry up the rubber cover lifting itat the right edge (the right edge is slightly larger than the left edge of the rubber cover). Lift it about 1/16 ofan inch and then swing it up / out.If you get USA power plug, plug into phone and into USA outlet and charge the battery.CHANGE THE LANGUAGE: My phone's language was set to Portuguese. To get to English:1. hold down the end-call button (which is also the on/off button) on the phone to power it up.2. press upper left button - Menu3. reply ""Si"" (yes) using the upper right button.4. Enter 9 (settings) Ajustes Configuracion & Herramientas5. Enter 3 (Language) Idioma6. Enter 2 (English) Ingles",192.0

It is a great phone for $200....I wish that I had did a little more research because this company Blu make a whole bunch of phones that may be a lil bettter especially if you are not looking to break the bank on a phone. I saw a phone listed here on amazon for less than $60 and it's HD....but I was looking for an extra phone just to have instead of my iPhone as stated earlier I am not that big on iPhones.I have taken quite a bit of photos with this phone and I LOVE THEM!!! they are crisp and clear, true colors!! The videos are just as amazing, they capture all the pimples and freckles! If you are looking for a moderately priced phone this is a great buy for that Android user who is not trying to give all the phone companies your bill money!

My co-workers and my husband chose the Blu phone....they said that the video and picture quality was much better.

It's actually the ONLY phone that tethered with my laptop. It's speakers were great for music and everything worked as it should for several days. I used a 32gb sd card and set the phone up to save apps to that. I don't play games but use lots of apps. Space was not a problem and the phone was fast and easy to use.STOPPED WORKING-Troubleshooting:Suddenly one afternoon it just stopped getting service. It indicated ""no service"". Couldn't make or receive phone calls. Couldn't get online. I use Straight Talk unlimited and neither the service or sim card were at fault. (I put the sim card from BLU DASH into my Sharp FX phone to verify it was not a problem with straight talk. It worked immediately. The Blu dash was to replace my Sharp Fx because the sharp would not tether with my laptop.) I could not find a user manual ANYWHERE for Blu Dash 4.0. I connected Blu dash to my laptop and used my home internet service to downloaded applications in hopes of correcting the service connection issue. Nothing worked. I reset the phone back to the original factory settings since it worked perfectly for almost a week, but still no service. I verified all the wireless network settings were correct. I couldn't make it work.I went to the BLU website and didn't find it to be very user friendly. As far as I could see, there was no ""search"" method available, so I had to click on everything in hopes of finding what I needed. Some of the icons I clicked didn't work at all. There didn't seem to be a place for customer reviews or questions, so I wasn't able to solve the problem by finding out what someone else did to fix this. I DID send an email to BLU regarding my problem but I did NOT give it a significant amount of time to respond. I did NOT call BLU in Miami to see if we could solve this over the phone because it would be a hassle for me. I would have to take the sim card out of the sharp fx, put it back into BLU DASH, reboot in order to be prepared for the phone call. If for some reason, I didn't get help at that time, I'd have to put the sim back in the sharp fx phone so I'd have cell service. I just wasn't up for all that. I'm kind of impatient and I would prefer a more customer friendly method to work through this technical issue.GIVING UP:I finally excepted that the phone I loved for almost a week was not going to be working anytime soon or possibly at all, so I will have to return it to amazon and purchase another. I really thought this was ""the one"". So disappointing.",2.0

245237,Moto G Plus (4th Gen.) Unlocked - White - 64GB - U.S. Warranty,Motorola,298.95,1,"Compatibility with Sprint is in Question---First off, to get a SIM for the Sprint network, you have to call customer support and spend upwards of an hour while they figure out which SIM to send you. They'll also want to charge you for it, and charge you for shipping. Since I was on hold for ~45 minutes, I got them to waive both charges.Next, the phone works 80% OK on the Sprint network. However, I had a strange issue where I could not receive text messages (SMS) while on LTE. I would either have to place a call (drops to 3G), send a text (drops to 3G), or force the phone to 3G mode to receive text message in a timely manner, otherwise they might be delayed 8-12 hours!Update: It turns out this was probably a quality control/hardware problem. I also had intermittent LTE coverage with this phone.Sprint blames Bring-your-own-device (BYOD); Motorola blames Sprint. A factory reset may have resolved my issue, but why should a phone used for 3 days require a factory reset?! It might be the firmware update that broke it, but there are compatibility issues that still need to resolve.Similarly, (10/2016) Sprint doesn't provide their ""Sprint Zone"" or voicemail apps in the play store, so it's not 100% compatible from that respect, though alternatives (Google Voice) are an option for some.To use Wifi tethering on this device requires a user to unlock the bootloader (voiding the warranty) and change the tethering flag in the settings, which is a shame, because my 4yr old Galaxy S3 could do this just fine.I ordered replacement phone from Amazon. I received one that had the dreaded ""Ghost Touch when Charging"" hardware issue, rendering the phone mostly useless when plugged in, but SMS worked now.A second replacement (within 2 weeks time) also had the Ghost Touch issue..Similarly, (10/2016) Sprint doesn't provide their ""Sprint Zone"" or voicemail apps in the play store, so it's not 100% compatible from that respect, though alternatives (Google Voice) are an option for some.To use Wifi tethering on this device requires a user to unlock the bootloader (voiding the warranty) and change the tethering flag in the settings, which is a shame, because my 4yr old Galaxy S3 could do this just fine.TL;DR: This Motorola model is a LemonPhone 1: Wouldn't SMS on Sprint LTE (out of the box)Phone 2: Dreaded Ghost Touch issue (out of the box)Phone 3: Dreaded Ghost Touch issue (2 days after opening)Tons of information in the Motorola and Sprint community forums",3.0

It works well, with some minor hiccups occasionally (it has turned off unexpectedly 2-4 times since I've had it). I have enjoyed having it as it meets all my needs. My biggest complaint is its very limited internal memory. You can't save apps on the Micro SD card (I bought a 16GB SanDisk); apps must be saved in the internal memory and therefore not all apps I want can fit, and I've always had to delete other apps to make room for new ones.

I wanted to use it on Consumer Cellular's network (they use AT&T towers) and since it was an AT&T phone- I thought it would work great. However, all I could do was actual calling: no texting or internet. I loved the heft of the phone and I liked some of its features. It was my first experience with a Windows Phone and I think I would have loved it if I could have gotten it to work. However, I never could get to a menu to change the MMS/SMS settings. So after hours and hours of searching online trying to figure out how to utilize all the features, I'm sending it back. My phone seemed to be new, as described. It arrived in a timely fashion, great condition- but the menu was in Italian.

However, I was about to leave the country for a work trip (6 weeks abroad) so when I called I was told they couldn't ship abroad, thus I decided to wait until I got back to the states.While abroad, I realized that the overheating had screwed up the camera. Regardless of whether I opened the camera on the official app or through a 3rd party app, I would get a pop-up report that said it couldn't access the camera. This waws particularly an issue if it was above 75 degrees ambient temperature; the hotter the weather the less likely that the camera would work- due to it overheating even more quickly. Multiple times, just trying to open the camera app caused the phone to spontaneously restart. About 3 weeks into my trip abroad, my phone's camera stopped working completely. I tried all of the google support team's suggestions and nothing worked.Avoid purchasing this phone unless you want some serious headaches.",5.0

Next I called T-Mobile they made me change a bunch of settings then the phone worked for like an hour. Then my data started to slow down a lot!

The battery is very impressive. The screen is almost as big as a tablet. The photos and video are played vividly with all the details because it is a HD screen. The GPS works fine and just slow start, it takes about 5 minutes to track satellites at the start and then it is ok. It does not come with a SIM card because it is unlocked.

I've had experience owning different kinds of phones (iPhone 6, 6S, Galaxy S, Nextbit Robin) and I like this one. This is my second BLU phone (had the Life One X) and I will never pay for another phone through T-Mobile at full price - unlocked phones are the way to go. I like that BLU provides a number of accessories - a case, earbuds, screen protector, charger. I also like that the charger fits the phone when the case is on.

This phone gives you a lot for the money. You cannot compare it to the Nokia phones at the same price range. The software/screen/extras are way better. FM radio is a blast! Very clear even without any external headset. In contrast, my new Moto G 2015 does not give you this good reception without a headset. Display is very nice - big, bright, smooth and colorful . Navigation is quite intuitive after 5 minutes playing with the phone. Performance is good. I cannot comment on its call performance since I am only using it with an international sim to receive text messages. The cover is very easy to remove but I found the battery pretty hard to remove. The manual does not indicate how to load the SIM though there is impression embedded near the SIM card compartment. I used a video on YouTube to confirm that I was doing it correctly. Hint - Insert the first sim all the way in until it is flush with the border.

It definitely takes longer than 5 seconds to open up an app and sometimes you just get a black screen and have to exit out of the app and then back again to get it to work. The GPS doesn't know what it's doing half the time and just outright fails the rest of the time. The screen on this phone is also horrible. Words come out blurry and when you try zoom in closer to make the words somewhat legible, the screen lags. However, the worst thing on this phone is the keyboard. It absolutely sucks! There are very few times that it will actually type the letter I want. It usually types the letter next to it. The delete button has to be hit a few times to work, it's just a complete nightmare. It's making it a nuisance to text.Overall, I don't really like this Blu Advance phone. It's just a laggy mess. I've had Blu phones before, but this one is definitely the worst of the bunch. Thank God, I'm not much of a phone user (only use it for internet on the go and even then most places have wifi, so I tend to use my iPod Touch), because if I was, I would send it back.

Responding to anything via the keyboard is taxing. it is so small and the digitizer is not ver accurate making for a impractical device. The Android kitkat OS is stripped down, glitchy and not intuitive. The Clock kept disappearing from the status bar. There is no OTG support, and the USB charging port is so deep all other cables are nearly useless. that is just poor design. the screen is so small most apps, webpages, etc are forced off screen or the text is forced into a intolerable vertical format. The battery is poor and the indicator is useless. The softkeys are lighted only and the light goes out very fast making navigation frustrating... and there are almost no settings to control anything. The settings are not all in one place as you will find trying to change the lock screen image.That said it will run netflix and other streaming services. the bluetooth devices I paired worked fine. It tan NES and SNES emulators with little lag, but had to use a BT game pad. the FM radio was a cool bonus in the face of US released phones...wanted this to be awesome, and for what it was it was ""neat"" but nearly useless. if the screen area was larger to the phone outer size it would be awesome.even with NOVA launcher, and other tweaks this phone is just not practical for daily use.

Buttery Smooth performance along with speed and the camera is just amazing, so many great things about this phone that I can go on about. I have read that people are upset about Sony not including the fingerprint scanner from the power button which to me is not a big deal since I have not yet to use it on my previous devices so I honestly could care less of the feature and I also doubt that I would ever use it if it was included.

Love the S7 Edge though. This dual SIM version wouldn't handle the two carriers cellular data properly. Once on wi-fi it would rarely transition to cell data without a reboot. Even then it didn't like two SIMs from different carriers. Suspect it is meant for two SIMs from the same carrier only. If I inserted a single SIM only, it worked better, but oddly my TMo SIM only got less than 1Mbps on band 12 LTE when the same SIM in a different phone pulled 15+Mbps consistently. ATT speeds when only 1 SIM inserted were consistent with other phones. If I can only use one SIM I might as well buy a single SIM US version so that wi-fi calling and VoLTE could work too, which they don't on this international version.Beyond the dual SIM issues, the Galaxy S7 Edge was a great phone.

The plastic build has some defects on the corners, some paint imperfection but you really had to look for it. Peformance wise I didn't noticed much from my HTC m8 I would say I'm not hard core on my mobile devices, just social, YouTube, some games and lot of web browsing. The nice touches of reversibility and double tap to wake are great additions and make a lot of sense ( although I forget its hard to take a picture upside down ).

So far, the battery life is quite good, but I'm usually using only basic text, phone and minimal data programs.My biggest concern was whether an ""international"" dual sim card phone would be compatible with my existing StraightTalk prepaid plan in Illinois. I ordered my new NANO SIM card and got the phone up an running without a problem. Originally, I struggled with getting the phone to receive data, which is included in my carrier plan.

It feels made of premium materials, nice touch with the metal band and slick glass screen. Screen protector isn't necessary with this device.I got this phone to finally get LTE with my service. I've always used international phones mainly because I travel often and I also prefer my phones to be vanila from the manufacture. No carrier branding, tweaks/restrictions or bloatware.And yes this phone works 100% with T-Mobile LTE, at first it didn't, I thought I ended up with the wrong phone after reading countless answered questions and forums about the N910C. It turned out I had wrong APN settings and I needed to update my SIM card to a newer one that supports LTE.",10.0

Just like the Prior Unhappy Buyer of this Same device did a few months ago, I have to return this crappy cell phone to the UPS store tomorrow morning (Jan 6, 2012) for a 100% refund. I'll explain below how I know there is a Prior Unhappy Buyer of this defective Cell Phone.Today (Jan 5, 2012), I'm extremely disappointed about 5 minutes after I opened the package. First, I noticed a PRIOR UNHAPPY BUYER returned this piece of crap, defective cell phone in October 2011 (just a few months before me). The ""Return due to Defective Product"" notice dated in October 2011 was still attached to the package sent to me. The seller is Warehouse Deals, Inc which is a subsidiary of Amazon. The seller Warehouse Deals, Inc must be thinking that if the Nokia C3-00 is defective in one unhappy buyer's eyes, it must not be defective in the next buyer's eyes. HELLO! Defective is defective - it means internally mal-functioning, it's not merely external/superficial beauty in the eyes of the beholder.I have owned several older Nokia cell phone models, so I began testing several functions. Immediately, I noticed that the Right and Left Key (just above the alpha & numeric keyboards) are not responsive when I try to select on-screen options. The only time the Right key works is when switching on/off the device. I gave my benefit of the doubt by pressing the key at different strength: hard, medium and soft, but nothing worked. Then I immediately went to online chat with Nokia online support to explain my problems with this device. The Nokia online support confirm what I know about Nokia devices from my own experience, that it is NOT normal for the Right and Left Key not to be responsive to on-screen selections (in other words, I wouldn't need to press more than 1 key to pick on-screen selections). On all my prior Nokia cell phone, you only need to press 1-key (either the Right or Left key to select your on-screen option).I've had a string of bad luck ordering this Nokia C3-00 unlocked cell phone (a very long story, prior to receiving this defective cell phone, I made at least 3 telephone complaints about an Amazon Rep. called Amit Y. who made unauthorized cancellation on 2 good, valid and in-stock orders without my permission. This is really testing my patience on purchasing electronic devices from Amazon. I am totally disappointed with this device and I will return this crappy defensive cell phone at the UPS store tomorrow morning for a refund.",5.0

The reason I gave it four stars instead of five is due to user feature preferences. The phone is too small for me. The keyboard is impossible to read and maneuver even when wearing my reading glasses. When you get that over 40 eyesight, things like that really matter.The other issue I had with functionality is that I could not figure out how to switch over to speaker phone once a call was initiated. Also, if I made the call with the speaker phone from the onset, the screen kept reverting to a different screen instead of staying on the features I needed. I found this to be a major inconvenience as you would lose the touchscreen to press numbers when prompted during a phone call. Again, this is not necessary a phone quality issue, but more so a user preference issue.",2.0

It's so huge it's almost like watching it on my tablet!The sound is impeccable and very clear and it gets really loud.I really appreciated that I didn't have to go stand in a long line at the phone store to get it turned on and to have everything switched over.All I had to do was just take my sim card out of the old phone and insert it into this one and everything instantly transfers over and it instantly starts working. I am not a big tech savy person but I also don't have the time or patience to stand in the lines at the phone store, so for to be able to just put my sim card in and get it to work is really amazing and I have to say one of my favorite things about this phone because it really saved me time and money this way.It was super fast to be able to not only connect to WiFi, but it was very easy to connect to Bluetooth not to mention how fast it was to connect!This phone has many different options like ringtones and more and this fits my personality so well and has everything on it that I find important to live an every day life when it comes to technology.It's a very affordable phone and I love everything about it!I instantly noticed a big difference with this phone compared to my last one and I can now enjoy so much more on my phone and I love that about this!Disclaimer: I was able to purchase this product at a discount or for free in exchange of my honest and unbiased opinion",1.0

308624,"Samsung Galaxy Exhibit 4G (T-Mobile), t679",Samsung,119.99,2,"I bought this phone Jan 2013 . October 2013 running minimal apps , the phone began to exhibit ( no pun intended ) all of the worst characteristics described in myriad other 3 and 2 star reviews . Slow page loads , freezing or locking up , black screens , inability to complete calls in urban areas to name only a few . Aside from that it was almost impossible to nail down a rooting procedure that was less complicated than Newton's theory of relativity ! As if that wasn't enough it developed a behavior of turning itself off and on at will , and becoming very hot , while consuming all its battery power every 10-12 hours . Since I travel to various cities frequently this was not only unerving and frustrating , but a SERIOUS business communication handicap . I actually began to travel with an accessory battery charger and TWO spare batteries as well as the wall charger . Near associates were infinitely amused to observe me changing batteries in my phone once , or even twice ( on heavy use days ) while their phones remained stowed . All in all it was a great product until real service and current communication demands were placed on it . Then its performance diminishes and becomes irregular very , very , quickly . This will be a great phone for a user with only the most very basic demands ( i.e. basic talk - text and photos ) . I have since returned it to Samsung , where it was factory refurbished . In the meantime I purchased a Galaxy III with which I am quite pleased with and has absolutely no difficulty negotiating the same apps , and more that I had on the Exhibit 4G and very good battery life for a smart phone . The Exhibit all in all was not a bad phone . But if you are a heavy phone / data user you will outgrow this phone really fast , and subject yourself to a great deal of frustration .",1.0

I decided that, like most mid-twenty white girls, I wanted the larger screen for my cell phone as well so that I too can take unnecessary mirror selfies and slay.I scoured Amazon for a few days comparing the under $100 android unlocked phones. Despite the desperate need to look fly, I'm ballin on a budget. Riding broke bitch status, ya feel me? Anyway. I read review after review of the Posh Titan HD 550 and all seemed positive. Watched unboxing videos and reviews on YouTube and decided to go with this phone. I was elated the day it arrived. Couldn't wait. Selfie time. BAM! watched me!After a few days of use I noticed the phone started to slow down. Touch screen response time was under-par and the camera was...frankly it was s*** and the beauty cam feature was comical at best. The phone boasts a 13mp camera but what is that when the display can't give justice to its own features? The video even lagged like a ghost trail of I was recording my daughter playing or even opening gifts on her bday.Battery life was the WORST of any smart phone I've ever owned. My phone stayed on the charger constantly. And if it died, you can forget it. An overnight charge was lucky to get you 70%. It did do this weird quick charge thing where it went from 5% to 100% in 10 minutes but then without warning it would die before I'd even get home and that was with the phone just on standby.Hated it.

I had a cheap nokia a long time ago and I always found that it had the best reception and best battery life of all my phones. Let me give you a little info about myself. I work at a cell phone kiosk in Sam's Club and so I deal with phones with sprint, att, and verizon. I think of myself as very knowledgable about cell phones. I have had many! Here are my pros and cons about this phone:Pros:1) Battery Life: I have had many touch screens (instinct, moment, hero, pixi, G1) and of all the phones I have had the battery life lasts sooooo much longer. I have been playing with my phone all day running the wifi, making calls, downloading games, playing games, and my battery has not gone down at all.2) Speaker: Sound is so clear and loud. Probably the loudest I have had.3) Ease of Use4) Size: Not heavy at all and fits perfectly in the hand.5) Screen: Very vibrant and great for watching videos.6) Music: Once again great sound!7) Short cuts on main screen make it really easy to get to contacts you use a lot!8) Ovi market: So many free games that are really well done.

397184,Sony Xperia Z5 Compact E5823 2GB/32GB 23MP 4.6-inch 4G LTE Factory Unlocked (BLACK) - International Stock No Warranty,Sony,467.73,1,"**SEE UPDATE BELOW**I've been using this phone for over 3 weeks now and I so glad I went with the Z5C.HARDWAREIt heats up a bit when doing heavy gaming or long video recordings, but not all too concerning...especially considering I don't notice any heat during typical daily operation. I would say the battery is adequate but it wouldn't be considered one of the strengths of this phone. I don't imagine battery life gets any better with other phones unless you go bigger...which, why the hell would you be looking at this phone if you were willing to do that? Go with the Xperia Z5. That said, I haven't experimented too much with ""stamina mode"" but if you use alternate messaging services / apps (like Google Voice) or music streaming apps, you'll have to add those apps as exceptions to be able to use data when the screen is off...which will diminish the benefit of ""stamina mode"" and preclude you from using ""ultra stamina mode"" all together. This is my first Quick Charge 2.0 device and I'm very impressed with how much charge you can get out of having it plugged in a just a while (ie 10 minutes). Wireless charging would've been nice to have but I'll gladly sacrifice that feature to get dual front facing speakers, expandable memory, and water resistance.Speaking of expandable memory. My buddy was playing with a camera-equipped drone his girlfriend got him for Christmas and was bummed he couldn't get the videos off the micro SD card (he didn't have an adapter). Everyone at the party (iPhone users) was blown away at how I was able to get and share the video by putting the micro SD card in my phone and using Google Drive to share it. I don't know why we are letting phone manufacturers sucker us by buying phones without expandable memory.At 720p screen resolution / quality looks great to me. If reading small text is difficult or annoying or you plan on watching HD full-length movies on your phone, get a bigger phone. I have excellent eyesight and find this display great for watching YouTube videos or reading articles.I don't take a lot of photos / videos but I'm pleased with the camera so far. You can find great camera comparisons online. From what I found this camera is great but Samsungs perform better in low-light and close up focusing...but the Z5C is a huge step up from my HTC One M7 when it comes to low light pictures.SOFTWAREI was a big fan of HTC's Sense UI and didn't know how I'd like Sony's UI as this is my first smartphone from them. After downloading an HTC-like free clock / weather widget, I like the UI a lot. Screenshots and screen capture are particularly easy and fun. Still waiting for Android 6.0 Marshmallow update that was promised (see summary below).SUMMARYAs far as I know the perfect phone doesn't exist but based on the other flagship phones available right now and my preference for water-resistance, expandable memory, and front facing speakers...I was prepared to give this phone a perfect 5 stars. I'm giving it 4 however because it would appear that Sony is following the lead of others by promising ""soon"" updates to the latest android version (6.0 Marshmallow) to help sell their new flagship phone but then making those of us who believed them and bought the phone wait around while the update is delayed. If the update comes prior to the new year I'll adjust my review to 5 stars. Almost 3 months for an update seems like enough time to tailor Marshmallow to their UI...if it was a priority.**UPDATE**This is the worst phone I've ever had. On paper it's great but I've never been so frustrated with lagging issue. I'll get a phone call while its in my hand and I'll mis the call because pushing ""answer"" is non-responsive. Killing apps helps a bit but I find myself restarting the phone a lot. I was hoping the Marshmellow update would help but its now March 8th & still no update. First & last time I buy a Sony phone. Since the Galaxy S7 is water resistant with expandable memory, I think I'll get it if a softwarw update comes soon & fixes my problems.",7.0

201314,Huawei Mate 2 - Factory Unlocked (Black),Huawei,229.99,5,"The phone looks pretty. I used the phone without recharging for 3 days, while I frequently browsed internet and watched two movies (~3 hours).The screen resolution is good enough for human eyes. It is hard to visualize difference in pixel density between the ~245 ppi screen of this phone and those high-end ~450 ppi full HD screens, such as those of Galaxy S4 and LG G2.The phone does not heat up at all unless I play some games which demand a lot of processing. To be honest, I do not recommend you playing games on any smartphone, as they are good at draining power and therefore will eventually kill the batteries.The phone runs apps as fast as (maybe even faster than) all the high-end phones despite its suboptimal CPU, probably because it does not need to support full-HD display. The 2 G RAM is more than enough for this phone. Usually, there is more than 1 G RAM free, while Galaxy S4 and LG G2 are often on the edge of being short of RAM memory. That is probably why Galaxy S5 and LG G3 now have 3 G RAM installed.Overall, I think the hardwares are well combined to allow excellent performance, although individually only the ~4000 mAh battery represents the best of its kind on the market. I highly recommend you buying a phone with a high-capacity battery rather than a power-draining super-high resolution screen which cannot be well appreciated by human eyes.The only thing which bothers me a little is the power key on the side of the phone as I frequently hit it unintentionally. It would be better to redesign it to respond over double or triple clicks. Is it possible to write up an app to accomplish this?",3.0

258684,New Nokia Lumia 1320 GSM Unlocked LTE Windows 8 Cell Phone - Black (No Warranty),Nokia,99.99,5,"Beside windows 8 and 8.1's store lacking some apps the phone is amazing. Being mostly an android user, and before this being on iPhone 5, this phone was very easy to get used to. I loved my Samsung Galaxy Note 2 and this phone, if you like large phones, is perfect. Not as big as the Sony Xperia Z Ultra, which is a little too big, but nicely larger then the note 2. The home screen is a little weird to get used too if you are not used to windows 8 on a computer or tablet, but it becomes very handy as you get to choose what you want on the home screen and what you dont want, plus you get to pick from a nice group of colors for your theme. The app drawer when you swipe left is great with a nice search list. The 720p screen isn't as bad as people think, everyone thinks its all about pixels, but you can get nice crisp 720p screens, just like this phone has. With Nokia Black colors on this phone stand out and you get great viewing angles and outside the screen is just as nice, Nokia has done great with there black screen technology. Another thing Nokia has done well is built this phone, but Nokia has a great reputation and builds all there phones like mini tanks!! They also have great battery life. The only minor downfall of Windows Phone is the small lack of apps and games, but the store is growing everyday so that shouldn't last long.Pros: -Build Quality -Large crisp screen -Windows Phone is a great android alternative, especially since its growing and growing everyday.* -Batter Life, can get 2+ days with moderate use, 1 to 1 1/2 days with heaver use. -Camera button, i love having the separate button for just the camera.Cons: -Windows Phone, at the time of this review, lacks some games and apps that android has.Overall i would recommend this phone to anyone who wants a break from android or just wants a whole new experience with this great phone! Coming from IOS to this was a great change and i would have to say, between android and WP8 i would have to say with WP growing and growing WP8 has to be my new favorite OS!!",5.0

142173,"BLU Studio 6.0 Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,292.99,2,"The phone is nice. It really is. Decent speed, huge display with great quality. Though the camera is 13 megapixels, it suffers from being really bad in low light situations. But it's a phone camera and I'm buying a phone for phone functionality, not for its camera. Battery lasts an entire day from moderate usage which is an arbitrary term, but I keep a battery pack on me just in case. Size is immense but thin. Won't fit in your pocket without changing how you walk. I knew this would be a factor when I bought the phone, not that big of a deal since I carry my phones in my vest pocket. For the price, it's quite nice.On the other hand, there is a glaring problem that happens on an almost regular basis with the headphone jack. I'll be playing music or a podcast and the sound will get staticky for a moment and then mute completely. After a random amount of time it'll resume playback at the point where it went out. Sometimes it happens once in awhile, but lately it's been just on and off and on and off incessantly. My 1 hour podcasts turn into 2 hours with all the cutting in and out. This does not happen when I'm doing Skype and phone calls while plugged in for some strange reason. One thing that seems to be working to alleviate the problem is simply using the phone while using the headphone jack to listen to audio. Once the screen goes to sleep, it starts happening again.I contacted BLU support and initially I was under the impression that it was a human responding to me, but after I was told to reset my app settings and hard reset my phone which worked only temporarily, I started getting in a message loop with who---or whatever was helping me out. They suggest hard reset, I told them I did that a month ago. They suggest hard reset again copy/pasting the previous message, I copy/paste my explanation that I already did it. Back and forth. All I wanted to do is just let them know that this sounds like a firmware issue that they should report to their dev team to resolve on their end, because none of their solutions are working and there is nothing to show that it's a physical issue with the headphone jack itself. But still, it's the same thing back and forth.Like I said. Great phone. But I've seen other people have problems with the headphone jack. I've been starting to carry my old MP3 player around to listen to audio instead. Given this issue and the bad customer service experience I think I'll be looking at other brands for my next phone, even if it means sizing down on the features.***EDIT*** If anyone has solutions for the audio problem, leave a comment on this review.

390662,Sony Xperia M4 Aqua E2363 Dual SIM 5.0-Inch Factory Unlocked Smartphone (White) - International Stock No Warranty,Sony,239.0,5,"I bought this phone from Marketplace seller ""Gotham's Cells."" It's the model destined for Taiwan, so the phone out of the box was configured in Chinese. You have to go into Settings to change the language to, say, English. Unfortunately Android is a pain to use, and each version sports a very different UI. This one runs Android 5.I got the phone primarily as a sync device for my beloved Sony a6000 camera. Secondarily, I use it as a backup phone to my iPhone. Android is very hard to use and configure, but this is one of the best Android 5 phones I've tried. It runs fast and is very responsive. Sometimes Google's Play Store is really slow but I know it's Google's fault, not the phone's, because I'd be on the same WiFi network and in the same WiFi range, and the Firefox browser runs fast all the time.If you have a Sony mirrorless camera like the alpha series, you need to download two apps from the Play Store: PlayMemories Mobile for downloading photos and videos from the camera, and (optionally) PlayMemories Online to upload the images to Sony's cloud drive (5GB for free). Of course you can forego the latter and sync the photos from the phone to your computer; I use a Mac utility Sony provides in addition to auto-syncing to PlayMemories Online (cloud storage). I'd have preferred a way to sync to iCloud but so far I haven't found a trustworthy way. Android is full of spyware and trojans and viruses, and everybody says Google spies on its users, which worries me.Within the confines of being an Android phone, this is an excellent smartphone. I recommend it.",1.0

Very portable and convenient.7) the phone has only a few default apps so it takes up little space for apps. You can download the apps that you need.Cons:1) There is no radio. but since i don't usually need this so I dont really care.2) camera quality is good but the angle is not wide enough, comparing to my old phones. I can't have it all, though, I know.3) not sure if the phone is water-proof. that is something I didn't need to worry when I was using my old Xperia ZR phone. But it will be fine. I have a sturdy and perfect-fit case with a cover.Overall:5 stars! Definitely worth $335!",2.0

I have been the owner of this phone for about a month and this phone has exceeded my expectations. The phone is 4.7 inches. It has good screen resolution. Has a 8MP camera with a LED flash and a 5MP front facing camera which takes decent photos. When my friends saw this phone, they actually thought it was a Samsung Galaxy. They were very surprised that it wasn't. The speakers work great. I have noticed that some reviewers said they had problems with their speakers and volume. I am happy to report that I have not had any issues regarding the speakers or volume. The only Con I can say is that I wish the battery lasted a little bit longer. I usually can get 24 hours worth of battery life before charging. Other than that, this phone is excellent for the price. I would recommend this phone to anybody who doesn't want to spend a lot of money on a Samsung Galaxy. This phone works great with Straight Talk!",0.0

133798,BLU Selfie US GSM - Unlocked (Blue),BLU,159.99,4,"UPDATE: Aug 3, 2015 my wife dropped her lovely Selfie phone into a bucket of mop water. It is not repairable, so we are ordering her a BLU Energy X Plus 5.5 inch screen with 4000ma/hr battery and Android Lollipop 5.0. Why not another selfie? Though the price on her original BLU Selfie has dropped to under $180 from the $250 we paid for it, she would sacrifice the 13mp cameras to gain the lighter weight, bigger screen, bigger battery of the Energy X Plus which sells for $140 and has global GSM. She did love her Selfie very much, but hopefully she won't miss it with the newer phone.Selfie Review:I am removing most of the detail on the original review simply because it will soon be unavailable1. A bit large case size and weight considering the 4.7 inch screen size.2. Solid, attractive design with a great quality feel, superb Amoled display, OCTAcore 1.7GHz CPU, 2GHz RAM, Unlocked GSM, dual 13MP cameras, very bright dual flash on the back camera, Gorilla Glass screen does not show grime or fingerprints unless you have grubby hands.3. Easy to set up initially by installing the ATT GoPhone SIM card from her old phone and manually add the contacts, select the Google Now Launcher App and her other preferences, she was ready to go in about an hour.4. Wife is a heavy phone user, talking much of the day, listening to music, browsing and messaging. She had to recharge each night.5. The Selfie has a special sound system which is outstanding. The earbuds included are some of the best I have used, super good sound and comfortable. In fact she accidentally dropped the earbuds and stepped on one, and I ordered her new panasonic buds, but she nixed that and uses her BLU buds scotch taped together.6. Cameras are outstanding. I can't imagine how some of the reviewers say they are not, but possibly they don't know how to use phone cameras or messed up the settings. We have taken selfie pics and snaps everywhere and though occasionally there was too much light or not enough, or we jiggled the cam, we got super nice shots on most occasions.

Especially when the sales are poor and company loses money every month.I was wrong.Not only the OS is half-baked, no useful programs, no maps of my region, no even descent music player. In addition, the phone reboots itself for no reason, 2-3 times a day, no matter what I do.That is super-annoying.Having said that, I admit that I like the overall idea of WP8, but honestly, implementation is horrible.To whom I would recommend this? I dont know, maybe to my family's enemy or to some crazy microsoft lover/Nokia geek, so he/she could spend days and nights setting up and rebooting this useless piece of hardware...I dont know. Seriously, with all this hype around Windows Phone platform, and how it is so much better then other competitors - why is the flagship hardware, backed by 2 super corporations, is so buggy, unreliable, useless? How come?",

341204,Samsung Galaxy S3 SGH-i747 4G LTE GSM Unlocked 16GB No Warranty (White),Samsung,88.0,1,"I bought this phone to use for international travel with local SIM cards. But this version of the Galaxy S III is a terrible phone. My wife uses the US Verizon version and it works fine. But the i747 unlocked version is a dud. First and foremost there are no back or menu keys, either on the bezel or on the screen. There is just a single home button in the middle of the bottom bezel like on the iPad. The bottom bezel is metal. But Android isn't designed to just use a Home key as is the iPad. With Jelly Bean many of the Android applications have been updated to not rely on the back and menu keys. But even many of the updated apps haven't extended that functionality into the depths of their settings menus. It's easy to get stuck on a screen with this phone and have to kill the app in Settings, or with a Task Manager app to get back to a main app screen. Some app features are just not available since you can't get to their settings menus because there is no Menu key.The phone itself has some software problems. The screen periodically locks up. It's particularly annoying when trying to take a quick shot with the camera. To unlock the screen you have to turn the screen off and then back on. Occasionally you have to restart the phone.The camera is quite poor. The photos are totally washed out if there is any indirect sunlight on the subject. Midday with the sun overhead is fine. But if there is any sunlight coming in a window or door opening the photo is over exposed and useless. Of course low light photos are out of the question.I was ready to throw this phone against the wall and certainly replace it when I got home from travel. But it was stolen at the end of the trip. So good riddance. I've replaced it with a wonderful LG Optimus G for less than half the cost of the SIII. Samsung really fell down when they released this model of the SIII. It should never have gone out. Don't even consider it.",3.0

The camera's are both quite pixelated and don't expect to take any art worthy shots, but they do the job!Still working out the bits and pieces that go with a new phone, but I'm very happy with what it is for the price.Just do note - it takes a regular sized SIM card so if you currently have a micro SIM or anything you'll have to get an adapter (or construct one like I did)Pretty solid seeming little phone and should do the job :)",0.0

Then we added a fourth and although it has the same model number, it is a different phone. After researching this a bit on the net, we found that HTC makes these in both China and Taiwan. The original 3 phones we got from t-mobile are the China models. This last one we bought was an unlocked model and happens to be made in Taiwan. The China models are great, the Taiwan models are lousy - screen is dull, sound is bad, and in just 6 months the paint/finish in the back has started to peel. Look under the battery to find place of manufacture. I am very surprised that HTC would do this. We wrote to Amazon to request a return authorization, Amazon promptly forwarded the request to the vendor, and the vendor comes back to say that the return period has expired!",0.0

Sony is recycling defected returns so you are putting your hard earned money at risk. Unless you don't expect to drop it, or similar ordeals. Here's my experience with xperia. I have gone three three defected xperia over just eight months. I got the first one from t-mobile and the camera button kept pressed after 12th days. I was able toget t-mobile to get me the second one. After using the second one for about seven months, the USB lid somehow getting enlarged a little, so it could not be closed tightly anymore unless i pressed it in harder. Because of this, it got water in one time when i forgot to do the harder press before giving it a little hand wash. The water made it not connectible, unable to get wifi nor making calls. I then bought the third one xperia 3+, and it only last three weeks failed to handle a 3 feet drop. Before this drop, i kind of getting the feeling this phone was a defected that got whatever it's previous problem fixed and thengot turned back to the market. Therefore, i purchased a tough case for it. But, it couldn't handle the 3 feet drop and it's screen stopped showing anything. I tried for few days and it's display just no longer working. It's only the display that stopped working on this of my third xperia. Now i learned the hard way that this Sony's xperia has really quality issues - both brand new as well as replenished. When i later went back to t-mobile, they have already stopped selling or discontinued the xperia phones. We chat a little about all kinds of problems with xperia and concluded it's a good phone if it doesn't getting broken, which proved to be a bit lacking. I switced to Samsung S6, and so far i got a small drop and it's still functioning well. Sony will keep recycling fixed phones back to the market. I got to say they didn't do well on durability testing before bringing xperia 3 onto the market. So, you better get insurance when you buy one. Read carefully the ones they are selling through retailers like Amazon and you will notice the are mostly unlocked (which is nice), but they are NOT warranted. From now on, i would rather look at reviews that are from long time owners.",5.0

See end of review for this update.I have been searching for a feature phone since my trusty Sony 580 died over a year ago. I neither have, nor want, a data plan. I don't use internet on my phone. I was happy to find that Nokia was still developing for this market with something more than your bottom-of-the-barrel Go-Phone, which is what I had been using since the demise of my Sony.I have had the phone about a year. I don't love it like I did my Sony, even though it has some features that are better than the Sony, like standard jacks. Here are my opinions/experiences with this phone:  Pros:        1.)  It works as a phone - I can hear my callers and they can hear me. When set on full volume, calls through the handset are uncomfortably loud. (Not so much through the speakerphone - see Cons, below.) Clarity could be better - the sound IS NOT comparable to a land line phone - but voices are less muffled than on the cheap Go-phones with which we've been making-do. I've never had a smart phone, so can't compare the sound quality to a high-end phone.2.)  It has 10 alarms that can be set for any day of the week or one time only, with a snooze function that is variable between 2 & 59 minutes. You can choose your alarm tone.3.) The calendar has multiple choices of reminders, including birthday and anniversary that calculate age and are set for the life of the phone. You can also set these reminders through the directory.4.) The calculator has the normal calculator functions, but can also be used as a scientific or a loan calculator. It also has these common choices: 1/x; %; square root; x squared; MS (memory store); MR (memory recall); C (clear); and plus-minus.5.)  Notes and To-do lists. As a trial, I put in 21 To-Dos and 30 Notes. 30 is the limit for notes. Probably the same for To-Dos.6.) Speakerphone/loudspeaker for calls and music  7.) Stopwatch8.) Countdown timer with alarm9.)  You can set it to 3G, GSM or dual mode. Better battery life with GSM.10.)  Flight Mode. Easily accessible.11.)  You can add units to the conversion calculator. This is particularly useful since this phone was not developed for the US and many US equivalents were not included. For instance, there is a conversion for Acres to Square Kilometers but not to Square Miles. The is even a folder for ""Lifestyle"" conversions to add equivalents not found elsewhere. I added Miles per Hour vs. Kilometers per Hour, as there is no velocity converter. All converters are backwards compatible.12.)  Unit lights up briefly to alert you when fully charged, but does not play a tone. This is infinitely better than my Go-Phone that would awaken me when I was charging the battery overnight.13.)  You can opt out of emergency alerts. My Go-Phone had no such option. Amber/Silver alerts are important, but not in the middle of the night or when I get an alert from 300 miles away. I can opt in again if weather alerts are likely.14.)  You can set an access code separate from a pin code to control access to certain operations like the browser,  app purchases and downloads.15.)  You can set a time limit on your phone Profile (normal, silent, meeting, etc.) so you don't have to worry about forgetting to reset your phone after you've been to the movies, etc.16.)  I had no trouble with MMS messaging. I didn't have to do anything to set this up with ATT. It worked right out of the box. Unlike some other  reviewers, my phone is recognized as a ""dumb phone"" by ATT. 17.)  Has a radio and a music player. I have some issues with ringer & speakerphone volume, but not with radio & music volume. I often listen to podcasts & I can hear the spoken word clearly without earbuds. Radio only works with earbuds, as earbuds function as antenna. You can set it to play through the earbuds or through the speakerphone speaker. 3.5mm standard earbud jack.(Update: got a tablet that is much more convenient for podcasts. Still use the phone as a radio and love this function.)18.) Standard micro USB charging jack. Infinitely preferable to proprietary jacks!19.) Programable left and right selection keys. I programed my left key for a list of shortcuts to tools/apps that I either use infrequently or are difficult to remember how to access.  My right key is programed to take me to my address book.20.) Programable soft keys. A straight press of the central Navigation key takes you to the Menu screen. Pressing the sides of the Navigation key up, down, left or right functions as soft keys. You can program these soft keys with frequently used shortcuts, like Create a Message, or to take you to the Calendar or Calculator.21.) You can designate one person as your most frequent text recipient. Very convenient!22.)  The home screen is divided into four four separate sections for very frequently used items. The top section is slightly bigger than the others. You can choose from 10 items or you have the option to leave a section blank. Choices are: Calendar, Clock, Countdown Timer, General Indicators (I have no idea what this is. When chosen, it simply reads ""empty.""), Mail for Exchange, Mail, Notifications, Radio & Media, Shortcut Bar, SocialAccount or (empty).  I use the first section to display the time. On the next, I display the date, which also shows the next calendar entry, if there is one. My third section choice is Shortcut Bar, from which I can choose from 53 different shortcuts. Obviously, these shortcut choices are expanded from the original 10 choices given above. (This Shortcuts BAR is also different from the Shortcuts LIST I set up as accessible through my left selection key.) Some of the expanded choices: alarms, camera, calculator, etc. I currently have 15 items on this shortcut bar. I don't know if there is a limit or if you can choose all 53 shortcuts.  My fourth section is the countdown timer. I don't really use it all that often, but learned that this is the only way to easily display how much time is left on the timer when I do need a timer.Cons:1.)  There is no Tools file, but there are TWO Apps files.Apps file contains:  GamesAlarm clockCalculatorFilesVoice recorderTo-do ListNotesCountdown timerStopwatchAlso, within the Apps file is a folder called My Apps which contains: eBuddy (a now defunct chat app that eats up 615 kb)FacebookGoal (a soccer app, for pete's sake, that eats up 231 kb!)Mail for ExchangeNews and OffersNokia NearbyNotificationsSocialAccounts (to manage social networking)Store (Nokia app store to buy apps)The Weather ChannelTuneWikiTwitterWhatsAppand World Clock. In addition, there is ANOTHER icon on the Menu Page called More Apps, to store all the apps you buy or download. Can we perhaps have just ONE apps file for ALL the apps and a separate Tools file? Oh, and Calendar is a file by itself on the Menu Page. Might have been a good place for TOOLS! (Just saying...)2.) I cannot delete any of the pre-loaded apps from the phone. I equate this to bloatware. I am perfectly capable of choosing my own apps, thank you!3.) In order to delete any of the pre-loaded apps, (Facebook, WhatsApp, Mail for Exchange), from the shortcuts list, (the one I access from my left selection key), you have to go to Options, Select Options, open Applications List, then unmark the pre-loaded apps, then press Done. Took me a week of playing around to figure this out. Most of the other tools you might want on a shortcut are simply listed under Options. 4.)  There are four apps, (Store, Facebook, WhatsApp & Mail for Exchange), that you cannot delete from the Shortcut Bar. I NEVER use these apps, so find it irritating that I can't delete them. At least I can arrange the bar so that my frequently used shortcuts are listed first.5.)  Phone is very slick, especially the face. The keys are slightly convex. This combines into a less than stellar texting experience as my fingers frequently slide off.  And I feel the need to grip the phone tightly so I don't drop it. Getting a case helped.6.) If you want to add a new contact, you can only add their number and first and last name from the add contact screen. In order to add other information, you have to edit a contact. In order to edit a contact, you have to go to Names, then Select that Name (which feels like you would then call that person, but you don't) which takes you to a list of options, none of which is Edit. You then have to choose the left selection key labeled Options, then Add detail, where you can add numbers, add internet (web and email addresses), add multimedia (specify a ringtone or add an image, or add personal info (street address, birthday, note, formal name, nickname, company, & job title). In my Sony phone, you just had to highlight a contact name and hit edit which took you to a scroll down menu where you could edit/input info. 7.) You can't block calls from specific numbers, although you can block all calls. 8.) Menus, folders and files are not intuitive. You can probably finally find what you want if you are willing to devote a lot of time to playing with the programming, but this might be frustrating for users who are not comfortable with technology. 9.) Useless low battery notification. Mine notified me, (and I am being generous), maybe 3 sec before it died. Not enough time even to say ""I think my phone is going to die"" before it croaked. Sometimes, I swear, there is no notification at all. On my old phone I had at least 30 seconds, if not longer. Usually enough time to plug in before it died.10.) Really low ringtones and alarms/alerts. I've only downloaded one new ringtone, (brand-new, not copied from the Sony data card), but it isn't any louder than the ones already on the phone. I have everything set as loud as it will go, but ringtones are still almost mute. But at least I can hear callers. Speakerphone also low volume. Almost, but not quite, useless. Oddly enough, the standard tone for calendar alerts is reasonably loud. Unfortunately, you can't choose this tone for other things. I also tried recording loud tones through the Voice Recorder. Still comes out almost too low to hear. I wear the phone against my body and almost always feel or hear the vibration of a current call, so I can deal with this irritation. Oh, and turning off your phone or putting it on Silent does not turn off alerts. I have not yet found where you can choose to mute alarms for a period of time, like when in a theatre. I am going to be in trouble when I am someplace quiet and a calendar alarm goes off!  11.) Battery life nowhere close to what was advertised. I usually read/write 2-3 texts per day, have 3 daily alarms, occasional calendar reminders and talk anywhere from 1 to 3 hours per day.  My battery is then almost fully depleted. I MUST charge every night. As a test, I talked for an hour on a fully charged phone. When done, I was down one of the four bars indicating battery life. It took 54 minutes to re-charge the battery to full. I had hoped to be able to talk about 6 hours and still use all the other functions as needed. Not possible. If I have a heavy texting day, the battery life plummets. Texting just eats the battery up! Invest in a car charger - you'll need it. However, if you don't use the phone, you could probably get 5 - 7 days between charges. I have recently ordered a new OEM battery. If my experience varies from the past, I will update this review. (Update: new battery made no difference in battery usage. Texting still eats up the battery and I still charge every night.)12.) Phone resets itself to its default ringtone even though I copied tones from my Sony and set them as ringers for specific callers. New ringtones are on my data card, and the phone recognizes them, but I would have to reprogram the phone every day or two to have vanity ringtones. Life is too short. I gave it up and just use the default. 13.) There  is no way to turn predictive text on or off forever. You change capitalization by clicking ""#"" but if you click it too fast, you turn on/off predictive text. Also, no choice for numeric only. You choices are: ""ABC, Abc or abc."" if you want to use numbers in your texts, you must press and hold the key several seconds until the number pops up. 14.)  Loses texts. The texting feature includes being able to read whole conversations, however, don't expect it to sort your responses correctly! I often find texts from different people in the wrong conversational folder. Also, it randomly loses texts entirely. I recently (11/19/14) tried to look up a text that I specifically remember getting approximately 9/23/14. I looked through ALL my folders and this text is just gone. 15.) Several times now, the phone has ""frozen"" and begun vibrating and buzzing loudly. Then no buttons work. It has done this most frequently while listening to saved music files for a long period of time. For instance, I downloaded some white fan noise to help me sleep when traveling. The phone froze and buzzed several nights in a row while I slept, waking me from a sound sleep like a fire alarm. The only way to stop it is to pry off the back and remove the battery - not something easily accomplished when you've just awakened in a panic! I finally decided to leave the back cover off and just use the rubber case to protect the phone. Final Analysis: if I knew then what I know now, I don't know if I would still buy this phone. Most of the Cons are just minor annoyances but the freezing thing is pretty serious. Makes me question the longevity of the phone. Compared to smart phones, this phone is pretty cheap at about $85 out-of-pocket, but since I am one frugal mama, that is still expensive to me, especially if it is going to crap out after only a year or two. I might have been better off with an older high-end feature phone - one developed before smart phones took over the market. I seriously doubt this was engineered as well as Nokia feature phones were in the past.Update 8/28/2016: Well, I guess I have an answer to whether or not I would choose this phone again - I would. Or at least I would if it hadn't doubled in price since I bought it! I don't know how a discontinued ""dumb"" phone goes from $89 in 2014 to $199 in 2016. That is just insane! It isn't that great a phone! I liked a lot of the features, like having 10 alarms, and having birthday reminders in my calendar that also told me how old the person was, but not enough to pony up $200!I am a creature of habit, but I'm also a cheap SOB. When the Nokia literally took a nap with the fishes, I looked around for a new phone and ultimately decided I would buy another 301 - until I saw how outrageously they are now priced! Unfortunately, I also discovered in my research that there are 3 versions of this phone, only one of which will continue working in the USA after Dec, and only Amazon is selling that version. (Model RM-841. This info can be found on the white label under the battery.) Rather than pay the new extortion price, I hopped over to Kroger and bought a $20 Go Phone. Do I like it? No. It irritates the living daylights out of me! But when I think about it costing only $20 - I get a whole lot happier!One last Con I discovered since I had to get a new phone: you can port a phone's worth of contacts TO the 301, but woe unto you if you need to port your contacts from the 301 to another phone! The Go Phone necessitated a new micro sim card. AT&T couldn't read my old mini sim, even though I could still access it thru the 301. (Water damaged the in & out mics, but the rest of the phone works.) I had to bluetooth/slam each contact to the new phone individually: a process that took me over 4 hours!Update 9/14/2016: It took 2 weeks in industrial strength dessicant, but the 301 has been resurrected! All functions appear to have returned to normal. After a few weeks with the horrible Go-phone, I have upped my review to 4 stars. I know this phone won't last forever. I just ordered some cheap rubber port covers to try to avoid the humidity issues that almost trashed it this summer. I know I will be forced into a smart phone sooner rather than later, but I found I definitely like this phone better than anything else I can afford right now. (But it is still horribly overpriced at $200!)",13.0

There was hardly any changes - just nicer looking - so she didn't have much to learn.,

201300,Huawei Mate 2 - Factory Unlocked (Black),Huawei,229.99,5,"I ordered this, on a Saturday, received it on a Wednesday!The reason I ordered it, was because another ""flagship killer"" was unable to produce enough fo their ""killer"" phones to meet demand.Very high quality packaging, arrived in good condition. Turning it on, the battery was at 46%. I just set it up using wi-fi, synced myapps, set up email etc without issue. I don't know what people are worrying about, with it ""only"" being a 720p screen, it looks fantasticsitting next to my now retired Galaxy note1. The size is NOT that bad either. Spec wise, my note1 and this are pretty much thesame width & thickness, and only around 1/2"" longer, but, with those reduced bezels on the Mate2, that gives me 8/10th of an inchMORE screen size! Screen is bright & clear, no bad pixels. I shaved my standard size sim card down to fit it, came right up in H+mode (shows 4g on the display). Need to stop by Walmart (I'm on straight talk) and get a new sim so the LTE light will come on.I use bluetooth, and never the handset microphone or speaker, bluetooth is CRYSTAL clear, better than my note. The ring, sounds and other speaker sound is VERY loud. This one came with 4.3, which isn't a deal killer for me, it's an upgrade from 4.1.2 that I was using.I don't use the built in launcher, but opt for Nova since that is what I'm use to.Now, for that HUGE battery! Left this morning at 100% charged. After a couple hours of phone usage, few dozen emails, web surfing, text messaging, I still have around 90% left! It might take me a few days just to run the battery down, which is one of the main reasons I got this.I hate running out of juice.The camera, has some nifty features and the image quality is top notch. The built in software is pretty good, but I'm use to Camera FV-5, and the macro mode works pretty darn good!Huawei hit one out of the park, in my opinion. If you like big screens, you'll love this!Update, still going strong over a year after purchase. Huawei did update the device late June 2015, to LL5.1, and also provided an easy way to go back to JB4.3 if you didn't like it. First version of LL does have a couple minor bugs. If you switch the launcher, text messaging etc, from the default to a 3rd party app, once you power off/on, it goes back to the Mate2 default apps. If you are like me and never turn your device off, it's no big deal. The other minor bug is they need to tweak it a bit. It is using just a little more battery than before, but nothing that impacts that 2 day battery life. If I had to do it all over again, I would STILL get this phone, it's a winner!",11.0
390890,Sony Xperia Miro ST23A Unlocked Android Phone with 5 MP Camera and 3.5-Inch Screen--U.S. Warranty (White),Sony,120.0,4,"Update: T-Mobile sucks!Returning this phone. T-Mobile claims it is not compatible with their network - possible since it does not have the 1700 mhz band supposedly - yet I had been getting 3g for two days - all of a sudden - only edge. Oh well. If they are going to play games with teh bands on the phones I will continue to avoid their overpriced in store phones and will have to seek out a 1700 mhz phone until my contract is up with them.Wow. So far i really like this phone. Old phone was a Samsung galaxy S. It was getting old and had no internal memory - and as you know, not all apps can be moved to the SD card so I was constantly getting the ""low memory issues. This one seems to have enough internal to handle whatever cannot be moved to SD (time will tell.) But I really like the feel of this phone. Feels sturdy in the hand. A bit smaller than the Galaxy but has a more solid feel to it. In portrait that smaller size does make for typing issues but I find the microphone very accurate and use it most of the time to type. Battery life so far seems very good as well. I leave the Bluetooth on all the time and used WIFI on and off throughout the day and it doesn't seem to drain. (I tend to keep my phone plugged in anyway so it wouldn't be an issue at home. Also, it has a removable battery - for me this is a HUGE advantage as I can buy a spare for traveling or really long days and just swap out the battery.I have used SPB Shell on the Galaxy but it slowed it down too much. Loaded on this and ran great. But the Sony interface is so nice, I switched back to that.The only two quibbles so far are the size (keyboard) and the loudness of the speaker phone (too quiet) but I use Bluetooth most of the time so not an issue.Worked out of the box - threw in SIM card and memory card and off it went.So far, so good.",6.0

I've used some ""budget"" Windows phones from Nokia and decided to give the 950 a try a few months ago since it was being offered at a big discount to retail on Amazon. I liked Windows because I don't use a lot of apps (10-15 usually will do it) and all the ones I do use are on the platform -- if you are an ""app for everything person"" then Windows phones are likely not for you. The Windows 10 os makes *significant* improvements over the previous os and it feels like a well integrated, intelligent system to use. The build quality is at least equal to the Nexus phones and a step up from other Lumias I've used. Overall if you like Windows this is a terrific phone.",3.0

124332,Blu LIFE 8 Unlocked (Yellow),BLU,2000.0,4,"I have bought three of these phones from either amazon or ebay and had issues with all of them. The one from amazon (most current) was reburbished. I sadly had to send it back because of the charging port not working guess that's why it was refurbished. The two from ebay were used and new (supossedly). The used had lines going down the screen the new had issues with updating the software from 4.2 to 4.4 Kit Kat and when I rebooted it after putting my SIM card in the screen went blurry (factory reset fixed that but still...) I have own three different BLU phones with all them being good with minor to no issues. This is the first that I have seemed to be cursed not to find one that works for me.What I like about this phone is the size, it's a very thin and sleek design. The bezel and the white accent on the bottom don't bother me like some of the others reviewing this phone. I currently own a BLU Studio 5.0 LTE and you can tell the difference in the size and thin-ness of this phone compared to it and they look very similar. This has a smaller bezel than the Studio and the same colored accent at the bottom.I like the interface and I even like the 4.2 for what I used it in the day or so of usage on one of the phones. When opening up apps and websites it seemed just at quick if not quicker than the Snapdragon processor that is in the Studio 5.0 LTE. I never got the time to really ""use"" the phone but in the little time I did I really liked how it responded.I have tried three times to buy and like this phone but haven't been able to get one that works correctly. When the price is right I might buy a new one and start from scratch but with the experiances I've had it will be hard to do that. I like BLU and continue to support them. I'm looking forward to the New BLU Life One.Update 4-15-15:Okay so I bought this phone again for the fourth time. It is new and in yellow which has been a really hard color to find for the same price as the other colors. This one (so far) works. I updated the OS from 4.2 to 4.4 and it went great. It runs smooth, as smooth as the Snapdragon 400 in the Studio 5.0 lte that I have. With HSPA+ speeds it is just as fast as 4g. Which I learned that HSPA+ is technicely 3.5g speed buf for me that is plenty fast. One feature that's different from the Studio vs. the Life 8 is that it will show you a window when someone texted you. This is the difference between the 4.2 (and 4.4) vs. the 4.3 that's on the Studio 5.0 LTE. I like that feature.I love the size and weight of this phone. It's really thin and light weight compared to the Studio 5.0 LTE. I won't bore you with the same old stuff that I said above but I will say this one last thing if BLU reads these. The color accent at the bottom of the phone should have the speaker grill that's on the back of the phone placed in that void! It is a waste of space but I was noticing that they could have put their speaker facing forward. I'm no designer or engineer but I would think you could move stuff around on the inside of the phone to make this happen. Just a note to BLU for future phones. I would recomend this phone for those looking for a cheap alternative. I think I just got some bad quality control phones as stated above. It is a really cool phone.Update: 7-10-15:I sold this phone and bought a used Samsung S4 (Red). The bluetooth didn't work for a while and I even tested it on several speaders at Best Buy, it was the phone. For the first time since I owned a BLU device they sent out an update to the firmware and fixed the bluetooth feature right before I sold it. The only thing I ever had issues with any BLU phones was the GPS it never worked. The guy that bought my phone works at the same place I do and so far it works and he still likes it.",1.0

I was all set to order the wrong version when I realized the only difference is the letter at the end of the model number. I believe N910 means the Note 4, but the 'a' at the end of the N910a is the only way to know this is the version for North America. With that said...I love this phone! In fact I love it so much I bought one for my mother as well. I like that it has a bigger screen, without being huge. I use the auto screen brightness and built in 'Power saving' mode and don't have any issues with battery life. Also available is a 'Ultra power saving mode' for when you inevitably leave town without a charger. By turning off all the extra little features, switching from color to grayscale, and only running the few applications that you tell it to (like phone and messages) it greatly extends the battery life. For example I just switched my phone with a current charge of 59% and it has an 'Estimated max. standby time' of 10.6 Days. I've not had the need to test this out completely as it will charge from a common microUSB charger, but I have used it on a return trip home when I realized I had <15% power remaining. The ability to still send and receive calls and texts and still have more than a day of remaining standby time when I got home was amazing.",57.0

You only have the cloud for memory, if you're in a location that limits connectivity you don't have access to your stored music, files, pictures... I like being able to add 90Gigs of memory to my S5. The S6 also has a sealed battery compartment (Like the I phone) so you can't change the battery or carry extra batteries for long camping trips... You also have to keep a special pin on hand to eject or change you SIM card. That's very inconvenient during international travel and your changing SIM's. You get a better bang for your buck when you buy the S5. Hopefully the S7 will bring back external memory... So I have both the S5 and S6 but won't be changing to the S6.

185952,Honor 8 Dual Camera Unlocked Phone 64GB - Sunrise Gold - GSM - US Warranty,,449.99,5,if you're looking at this phoneyou've probably already looked at reviews and know about the specs. I've been using for nearly 3weeks one thing I've noticed is excellent reception. its Just a nice phone to use. If you go for this one you probably won't be disappointed.Update: on second month of use. I ended up learning that this is not a dual Sim phone. Not really huaweis fault that some YouTube reviewers stated incorrect specs. The confusion comes from a Chinese honor 8 that is dual sim and shows up on spec lists.I was interested in the in the dual Sim feature so i could try different prepaid data plans and also have an extra work number. But prepaids are easy enough to switch around. Currently T-Mobile 10gb for 60 or $55 auto pay seems like the best deal around.,8.0

The '10' operating system was and is an abject failure. It came out with the clunky all screen 10 a couple of years ago when BB tried to emulate the iPhone - a disaster. The 7 series is and was much better although now out of date - so follow Apple's lead - update the system don't scrap it. Do you see a NEW OS on the iPhone yes, but it's an upgrade . So now BB have an atrocious dated OS which was never designed for a physical keyboard and as if that wasn't enough they have an out of date camera and the slowest older processor on the market. It would not have been difficult to make the changes I recommended and win back millions of customers but this will not be happening any time soon. I am truly sorry. Bye Bye Blackb.......

The first charge was no problem but the second charge took 4 hours to complete from 20%. I am not sure what caused the super slow charging, whether at the time of charging, the phone didn't have a sim card. I tried everything I can do reduce battery using hoping to accelerate charging, including turning of location features, mobile data, screen brightness. If it still takes 4 hours to fully charge, I think I am going to return it. Is it just my luck or this is a common problem for this phone?As far as sim card goes, I had a LG G2 with Tmobile. I simply cut the micro sim card in G2 and it worked fine!! If you are a little adventurous like me, there are tons of tutorial videos and sim card templates to help you save a buck.UPDATE 5/6/2016This phone is awful. I've only had it for a bit over 2 months. First the phone started to take forever to be fully charged (1 full charge takes a night!). The phone kept telling me that the outlet I used was not good even though it was the same outlet I had been using and was good according to the phone. I contacted ZTE and received a replacement phone and found out that the charger was also a defective. At first I thought it was the USB cord so I used my other USB cord with the ZTE plug. Then the plug gave up just like that. Before this, I didn't even realize a charger can break. I mean, how can you screw up a charger?! My own USB cord is like 2 years old and still working. The ZTE one is only 2 months old! I contacted ZTE for a new charger and I received just the plug.... How am I gonna charge with just a plug?! Having this phone is such a nightmare!!! Now I am waiting for the new phone to arrive so I can get rid of this. Can't wait!",3.0

Music UI is only defaulted to default player. Some apps have control on screen lock but does not work on this though.4. Camera hardware is great but needs a lot of software touch.5.

It is way above and beyond the competition. I'm not going to go over phone's features in this review as they are all well discussed in many publications. I do want to comment on 3 features the phone has been critised for unfairly in my opinion: First is the price - some critics say it is too expensive. Give me a break! The phone costs $450 plus $40 you have to shell out for 128GB SD card. That is $500. Compare that to iPhone 6s or Samsung Galaxy 6s with 128GB at $850 & $900 respectively and you will realize that Sony phone is a bargain. And that is comparing apples to apples because Sony phone is surely on par features and quality wise with both Apple & Samsung. The second point of criticism is the lack of 1080p HD screen. Again give me a break! On 4.6"" screen you will NEVER notice the difference between 720 and 1080p resolution no matter how good your eyesight is. And finally the lack of fingerprint sensor on us version (it is available on the international version). In opinion of many experts in the field the fingerprint technology is not mature enough especially both security and reliability wise. Most importantly it takes me virtually the same time to unlock the phone with a 4 digit code as with a fingerprint scanner - I tested it many times on my wife's iPhone 6s. So get over it or get an international model if you can't. Thank you Sony for the awesome phone!",8.0

42687,Apple iPhone 5s 32GB (Gold) - AT&T,Apple,54.34,3,"Granted, this is an older model, but I prefer to hold at least the semblance of a phone next to my ear than a wanna be iPad (iPhone 6 and others). The format was easy to learn: I also use Mac computers. I like the touch screen. Would prefer NOT to have the Apple watch icon, which so far I fail to find how to remove.I don't harbor hoards of pictures, but do use the phone for my Kindle books (300+) and Solfeggio music (lots again) and the 16GB seems to be adequate for my needs. Basically, the phone is more for business than personal. It is my first experience with texting and have to admit, I have become a fan. Quick. To the point. Get 'er done. Important in our no nonsense little time work world.IMPORTANT TO KNOW: my account with AT&T is a monthly No Contract. When I asked about a contract, the sales rep told me because this is considered a ""third party"" phone, I was not eligible for a monthly contract. That requires buying your phone from an AT&T distributor or directly from them. For me this was fine. I got a great deal with more data time than a contract arrangement and my monthly is less than $50.Another Point to Ponder: No one really tells you that with this phone (maybe others?) every month it is best to completely shut it down to reboot. After all, it is a computer. I found this out when I lost capability to enter addresses into my contacts. A friend who had used the i5s alerted me to the reboot feature. Doing this, I have not had any further problems, mechanically.CON: that in a way all Apple products are intrusive into our life by recording and keeping a digital record of EVERYTHING you do on the phone: calls, texts, web sites. I understand Android does the same, but not as intrusive as Apple. I don't like this aspect at all. Be aware.PRODUCT was delivered per my special request on time. Product not exactly as described by seller and no instruction guide included. Because of some other customer service issues, I find it difficult to recommend the third party seller.",1.0

142576,"BLU Studio 6.0 Unlocked Cellphone, White",BLU,971.6,4,"Summary overall, i'm happy with it, except for slightly weak signal.I've had it over a year of rough use so far. A great deal for the price. (Note: looks like the price has increased since i bought it)- Worked fine when i inserted my ATT sim card with no extra tweaking.- Good battery life- Good camera (but it sucks in low light).- Good large screen (but not great in bright sunlight)- Browses web and plays video smoothly, Runs multiple apps with no glitches.- Battery cover feels flimsy, but this not noticeable once the include protective cover is on it. (but definitely NOT waterproof even with protective cover)- Sound quality even at max is a little quiet, both on calls and video playback. But only a problem if i'm in a loud room.- My only major complaint is that in weak-reception areas call reception and internet are the worst of any phone i've ever had.My partner also has a BLU phone (of a different model) and she often has full internet when i have none.- In areas with strong signal, its totally fine, and it gets good wifi reception.-The touch screen is oversensitive. (turns single taps into double taps)-The power button is in a spot where i keep accidentally hitting it when i don't mean to. (But that might just be me.)-It arrived with almost no pre-loaded apps which to me is a plus.-I recommend ditching the photo editing software that came with it and installing Snapseed instead (free, versatile, and ad-free).",0.0

142133,"BLU Studio 6.0 Unlocked Cellphone, Black",BLU,292.99,2,"I just sent a request to Amazon to return this phone. I've used it for three days. My two recent phones have been a Samsung Galaxy SIII and an LG G3. They were on Sprint and I wanted a large GSM phone. I set up and had used my dual SIM cards with TMobile and Cricket. Other than the dual SIM being cool, this phone is a nightmare. System freezes required me to remove the phone cover and take out the battery to reset. I mostly use social media apps and the browser. The phone was by no means under a heavy load. The final straw came when I had to take the battery out for the second time this morning because the phone wouldn't turn on. That's not acceptable.Another item to note is that every time I held the BLU, I could feel a low-level electric static sensation coming from it. Even through the silicone cover that comes with it. My fingers and forearms would start tingling to the point I didn't feel that holding the phone was a safe thing to do. I've never felt that before with other phones and I've owned a couple dozen over the years. I don't know whether my hardware is faulty to the point it was letting an electric charge out or these phones have a serious issue.

I gave the vivo to my mom, and the life ones to my dad and little brother because they absolutely loved them..so I had to get myself a new phone and I decided to get another blu since the excellent experience I had with those other phones... well I chose this blue life xl because I thought it was the 2015 edition (which is not )...the delivery was very fast as always.. when I took it out of the box I was lightly disappointed because the screen had some lines like pixels with rainbow colors and if you watch the phone from different angles they're more notorious and the back cap seems to be made of hard paper? It was a pain in the ass to opened because I didn't wanna break it ... next I put the battery in and charged until it was 100%..turned it on and started to set my Google account and information... everything set up so let's start:The screen wallpaper was blurry,but was OK.I downloaded all my apps and didn't run out of space..Put my 8gb sd card in to try the sound and the video reproducer ..the sound isn't great but is good and is better if you use headphones (not the ones that come in the box) ..I liked the big screen because you can watch videos and movies and the poor definition of the screen is not a problem there...Next thing I tried was the camera which I don't use so much...the rear camera is OK, take nice and clear pics, but the front camera sucks I took a few selfies and my face looked blurry...The battery life is great for how much I use my phone... check Facebook, instagram, snapchat etc.send a couple texts and make a couple calls of 5 mins and I got 70% of battery by the end of the day so I don't have to worry to leave the phone charging overnight I can charge it in the morning in 30 mins ...well now I put the sim card in ( I hate that I had to turn off the phone and take out the battery ) and it automatically recognised T-Mobile..but surprise it didn't support 4g?? Only 3g but that wasn't a problem for how much data I use..Well overall the things I didn't like about the phone we're:The screen is freaking hard to use, you have to push the screen several yes in order to open an app or when typing.. the definition is very poor..I couldn't turn turn the brightness down.. it always went back to high...Didn't save some default changes like the auto corrector keeps turning on...The camera sucks...I was going to return it but my sister came over this summer to celebrate His sons bday so I thought this would be a great present for a 10 years old.. and yes it was he totally loved it he plays games all day and watch movies in it.. so this phone was a great deal after all but Isnt good for a teenager or adult that use it for texting or social medial... but for $130 is a good deal",1.0

Sony phones are super user friendly and I usually just like the overall quality of their phones, but this phone is a game changer! I feel like this is the most luxurious phone I've ever held! I take lots of pictures so the first thing I played with was the camera, and I started to get worried because I read reviews it wasn't that great, but I think its wonderful. It does very well in low light and it seems to fit more into the picture, it also has cute editing settings for those who like to play with pics. It set up very quickly and I was able to update and download all my old apps that I liked in a reasonable amount of time. I heard phone calls were quiet but I made a few phone calls and played with ringtones and they seemed loud enough to me, the dimmest brightness setting is still very bright, and I was able to send and receive mms very quickly which is something I've found to be on the slower side with Sony phones. I have yet to test just how waterproof the phone is but based on videos and other reviews I've read I'm betting it'll hold up through anything I could/would ever put it through. The phone took just under 2 hours to fully charge and it actually does last 2 days! I put it through at least 12 hours of internet streaming and made phone calls and texts before needing to charge it again at the end of the second day, also I had like 12 apps running at once before I decided to close them all and you'd never even know all those apps were running it was so fast! I definitely recommend this phone to anyone looking into it.",0.0

The display is absolutely fantabulous, better than iPhones, showing even the most microscopic details into perfection. It is the fastest device I've ever used with the stunning 3 GB of RAM (compared to newest iPhone's 1 GB). I love photography and with the 16 MP (newest iPhone has 8 MP), this is by far better than even $200 dollar cameras you find in stores. The 32 GB of memory provide all the room I could possibly want. I have had this phone for over 8 months now and still have over 14 GB left after all apps and music have been downloaded. The speakers provide great sound (better than any iPhone) and the bulge of the camera can easily be covered by a case, and I don't think it's worth buying the S7 just for the flat camera. I haven't had a single problem with anything about this phone. Last thing, the charger for this thing is absolutely beast. It is a fast charger built specifically for this phone and charges from 1% to 100% in just 1 hour. I bought the wireless charger but never use it because of this amazing charger, I wouldn't waste time and money on the wireless because it takes so much longer to charge.

So I went to the android side and got this phone because I did not want to spend a lot, but wanted 4g speed. I got that.Physical size is same as the iphone. Screen is fine. Those that say it doesn't view well in the sun, make sure your brightness is turned up. Mine defaulted to the lowest setting and it took me a month to figure out that was the problem.Phone is light. Responsive. Call quality is good. 4g speeds are great, though sometimes I lose a signal, but I think that's not the phone as I live in a dead spot.Transition to Android was entertaining. Not the closed system of Apple, so there is some funkiness that I liken to the PC world, though not that crazy. Rooted the phone to get rid of a lot of bloatware, and I highly recommend you do that.Changed the theme to look like an iphone as I mentally have committed certain icons to certain functions.Battery life is fairly good. I can usually go a couple of days without charging and I use my phone a fair amount.When I was in the tmobile store, I drooled over the Galaxy S2. But in the end, I have an ipad, so why do I need a galaxy. This phone was cheap and highly functional.My only minor complaint is the lack of a better ""on"" button, as the power button on the side of the unit is a little hard to depress at times to wake up the phone. But I can live with that.All in all, I think this is a great 4g android phone for less than $200. Hard to go wrong.Ironically, I tried to buy this at the local tmobile store in my town to support local business. But because of the challenges the carriers have with previous contracts and lots of small print rules governing the prices of phones, the best they could do was $350. Hello amazon.",7.0

The other day I had some trouble with my flip phone and there are very few new ones you can buy so I went to my carrier and what prices on these phones with contracts to boot. I was going through Amazon and I see this phone. There is a video on line for this phone so I watched it. If you can read a picture you can do this phone. When I received it I put the sim card in and set it up myself. I practiced a little with it and now I am getting really good. I even hooked up my blue tooth for the road and figured out the speaker. I am so impressed with myself. The instruction book even has pictures (Yea)! I think the visual is pretty good because I don't have to put on my glasses. However I have fat fingers and the alpha part is tiny, but I don't really text. A stylus would help. I would recommend it to anyone who is afraid of the smart phones. All the accessories can be purchased online for under $5.00 each. I feel this was a really good value and I didn't have to commit to a new contract.",18.0

I was really impressed with how fast this cell works, for applications, contacts and any other operation.The QWERTY keyboard works, despite my fear before buying. Needs some time to get used to it, but in 2 days I already feel like I'll never be able to get close to a non-QWERTY keyboard. Ever.What the E72 needs to be perfect?More memory.I had a N96, with 16Gb mass memory storage, and slot for a 16Gb memory card. The new N97 has 32Gb of internal memory. So why the hell Nokia put only 250Mb of internal memory in this model?I had to give up more than half my playlists (mp3, aac, avi etc) to migrate for the brand new E72.The e-mail application, now. I use Gmail, and the configuration was so easy that my 5 year old niece could have done. In less than a minute, everything was working, and I receive the e-mails a few seconds after they were sent (I tested with some other e-mail accounts).I'm so excited the messages (SMS) and e-mails are now so easy to create, manage, send.... It's great!Other things I liked very much:- Excellent call quality: even when the volume is almost in the lowest notch, the caller can be perfectly heard.- GPS: Works great and it gets a position fix generally within seconds. The new Nokia Ovi-Maps app is great, a huge evolution compared to the previous version.- KEYBOARD AND TOUCHPAD: The keyboard is great. The new track pad navigation works for me. I read some reviews that criticize it. I honestly see no reason for that, maybe just the difference between scrolling up/down (the best) and right/left (no so good, but still works). Requires some adaptation at first, but in no time you get used to it.- UPDATES: Firmware updates worked great. No problems at all. Everything was working before, it all keeps working now.Conclusion: This phone is worth every penny. Wonderful.",1.0

Anyway I picked the white color because it's very attractive.CHSLING unlocked phone has 5.5"" Quad Core Android 5.1 Dual SIM Dual Standby RAM 1GB ROM 8GB 8.0MP Camera GSM/3G Quadband what else can you ask for?! For only 960x540 resolution the screen is surprisingly good. I Honestly this is almost as fast as are any Samsung Android out there. I've been playing games with this phone and I did not have any problems at all, no lag or anything. Battery last even longer. The quality of the camera on both front and back are pretty decent. I have been using it on facebook call and camera is very clear. Call quality is very good. I am very happy of my purchased. Thanks to my friend who introduced me this products. I would highly recommend this product to anyone or my friends.",4.0

Had I know about this limitation, I might have purchased a different model, as the primary use is texting.Edit April 18th, 2016-Unfortunately the phone has stopped charging properly.

Even though I have a 24 month warranty on the phone, I could not simply return it to the retailer for a replacement (who was very pleasant and tried to be helpful over the phone but when you pay this much for a product you expect better), because it was beyond 30 days. I was first told to contact SAMSUNG Vietnam, but they responded that the phone was distributed in Africa and that I needed to contact SAMSUNG Nigeria. They said that I would need to send the phone in and pay for shipping, which is not cheap. I did end up sending it, and now I have still not received my phone back after 3 weeks.

Is heavier than most average smartphone (or even some phablets), but when holding it, you know it can't be broken easily.The interface is fluid and fresh, although the customization options are limited to tile size and color.Pros:- Camera: the best smartphone camera I have seen in my life- Nokia apps and services: Specially Maps (Nokia Here) and camera-realated apps.- Windows Phone Marketplace: Many people complains about lack of apps. I found everything I need (mostly free and with no ads).Cons:- No LED notification: coming from BB, this is something I really miss, and I don't know why this is a missing feature on almost every modern smartphone.- Battery: It charges slow (very slow), and discharges fast (really fast). It took 3 hours to charge from 60% to 100% with a 2 amp wall charger. The discharge rate is more than 10% per hour (with regular use, no automatic backups/updates, low level screen brightness and only 2 backgroud apps running), so I cannot get more than 10 hours of juice.- WP8 still feels a little half-baked. Hopefully MS fixes some glitches in the upcoming updates. For example, inhability to close tasks more efficiently, the ""search"" soft button takes me to Bing, instead of search stuff inside the device, etc.Also, I must say that the seller (Heavy Duty Electronics) gave me an excellent service.

BTW, the last time I sent mine Pure XL in for service due to battery failure they were unable (unwilling?) to try to retrieve any data/photos from the old device.

I can barely hear people when I put it on speakerphone (which I used to use often). Also, it has had some quirky issues on occasion. Occasionally, the screen get's stuck and doesn't respond to my touch and I have to restart the phone to get it to respond. Also, recently the bottom buttons (home, back, menu) all started blinking whenever I am using the phone. The latest issue is it phantom dials people in my phone book, when I haven't even touched it.2nd UPDATE: After a year of use, I continue to have problems with this phone. I often try to dial a number and the caller can hear me but I can't hear them. Also, the screen get's all fuzzy randomly and I can't see anything on the screen. I never know when it is going to happen, so if I am using google maps and it starts freaking out I can't see the directions on my screen, or to type a text, etc....I've never dropped it, it's never gotten wet, and it has a protective case on. Also even though I have a 35 GB micro SD card, this phone won't let you put apps on the card, it fills up the small amount of internal memory and now I can't download any other apps because it says my memory is full. After all is said and done, it didn't perform as well as I hoped. It completely crapped out in just over a year (of course out of warranty, do they plan this or something?). Don't waste your money!

I'm a long-time Windows Phone user and just made the switch back to Android as Windows Phone is finally losing its steam and becoming less viable. I originally switched from Android five years ago because of ugly UI and excessive bugs. No more! This OS is beautiful and I haven't encountered a bug yet! It's also swayed at least one of my iPhone friends to switch back to Android. My only two gripes are that the phone defaults to Korean (must press a different button in setup to switch) and displays a lot of unnecessary notifications, but both of these are easy to remedy.If you're curious about how to set this up on your mobile carrier, I'd urge you to read up on it online, but it was very simple for me. I'm on T-Mobile, and I just popped the SIM card out of my old phone and put it into this one. Done. No set up with the carrier over the phone, no online activation--I was able to start using it immediately. The only real catch is to make sure the SIM card in your current phone is supported by this one. I think there are three different kinds of SIM cards. The ZenFone 3 has slots for two of them, so chances are you'll be alright--just check first.",

Yes, there are ways you can reconfigure for t-mobile but why go through all of that? The camera is acceptable in good lighting and close proximity but the flash is weak, total darkness. What kills this phone for me are no 3.5mm hole for my headset and the inability (as far as I know) to select multiple texts, pictures, etc for deletion. You have to press backspace and confirm delete, the most annoying procedure ever.I regret the purchase, but will keep the phone for 2 reasons......the MP3 player is solid and the phone's hardware and looks are admirable.

The phone itself is superb and came with Android vs 4.0.4. I inserted my Tmobile SIM and worked right away, no problems there. The issue is that I have not been able to get my laptop to recognize it yet so that I can use the Samsung KIES software, and I have been trying for over 5 days now. Whatever I try I keep getting 'Unknown Device' error when I plug it in. I tried on 3 different laptops with different OS's, Win7, WinXP, and Vista, all report the same issue.... all I can do is charge it when connected. I followed instructions from a dozen websites of people reporting similar issues to no avail..... So for now, I give it a 4 star rating as I have to use the Kies Air app to access it via a URL. I'll update this review if I figure out a solutionUpdate: 11/12/13:Changed to 1 star. I really like the form factor/speed/features but my experience with this specific phone is just getting worse, I believe I received a defective device and am about to return it.- After almost 2 weeks of trying suggestions from online research I am still not able to get any PC/laptop to recognize it. I even had 2 colleagues with similar phones try it on their PCs (that recognize their phones just fine) with their own cables but it still didn't work, so I know it's not my laptop and/or cable.- Charging doesn't always work: Sometimes when I plug it to either my laptop or wall charger it doesn't charge at all some other times no issues- And since I cannot rely on charging to consistently work I have to turn it off at night, and yesterday evening when I tried to turn it off it showed the android character and said ""Downloading, do not turn off target"" and nothing was downloading and was stuck on that for a few hours. I had to hold the power button down for a few seconds to force a restart.

It advertises as 4gb of internal memory (which is only partially true). In reality the internal memory is partitioned into two sections - Internal storage is only 1.4 gb of space, Phone storage is 4gb. I had to educate myself on the difference. Internal storage is where the phone keep all of your downloaded apps that won't transfer to the SD card, of which I have several. The ones I have would have just about maxed this out. The 4gb phone storage is for data like pictures, music and such. With the internal storage almost maxed out, downloading new apps becomes a problem because there is no space to put them as they go right to the phone and you have to manually move them to the SD card. Would it really be so hard to up that Internal Storage to a decent amount?? 2) After a few days of playing around with it, I turned it on one morning and the phone went straight into this weird testing mode that I have never seen a phone do before.

The customer service I received through the process, like when I had to cancel the order and re-order it was amazing, both from amazon and the seller. However once I received the phone, the camera on it was all out of whack, making pictures turn green or other strange colors. I live overseas in Korea now and there are no apple stores here, so I took it to someone who did repairs who had to take out the camera and put in a new one because the one it had was a fake. Next time I'll go for the new one. Besides this no issues except a crap battery but that seems to be common with iPhones.",1.0

Case is made a soft plastic and the phone is VERY fragile, so get a good case. I broke my screen in 2 weeks. But I am clumsy. GREAT thing is parts are cheap and easy to fix. Lets talk gaming! This phone is a power house and plays almost any game with graffix modifiers with no problems. Some games are not available because of the operating system but they are constantly updated. Bang for buck the phone is a great deal and I am very happy with it. Now the issues. I had to pretty much program the phone myself because the phone carriers had no clue.

Apparently this is a common theme with cheap s*** coming out of China these days. You get what you pay for.OLD REVIEW:Great specs for the price. Fair battery life. Dual SIM capability is practically unheard of at this price point.Cons: Comes bundled with some un-removable bloatwarePretty soon after getting this phone, I noticed a spot on the screen, as if someone were pushing the glass down on the LCD. Sure enough, pressing gently on the screen made the spot bigger.

172798,"CNPGD All-in-1 Smartwatch+GSM Watch Cell Phone, with FM, MP3/4, Voice recorder (Pink)",CNPGD,29.99,5,"Update: 4-6-2016TL;DR: Upgrading to 5 stars. This is a great watch for the money. CNPGD did a great job once again. If you want a sharp looking round-face design smart watch on the cheap, then this is a very solid build with excellent screen and feature set. You might need a different app for Android 5.0+ than what it comes with. Dig below for the app description.UPDATE: Take the time to install the right app. There is no way this is a 2 star smart watch unless you are expecting it to have a feature set other than what it actually is: a smart watch. It's not a phone watch, it's not a hybrid calling watch, it's just a fantastic little smart watch.By request - ALL the details:This watch has a lot going for it, with a couple of nit-picky cons. Let's start out with my device specs: UPDATE: Phone switch to - Digital Reign Journey Phablet with Android KitKat. Keep this in mind during the following information regarding the app, etc.# First thing is ... the mobile app that goes with the watch. It has a QR code built into the watch. Scan it and grab the app. Very nice looking app. I found one I like even better called ""TRULY SmartDevice"" - it is nearly identical in appearance and functionality, plus it works perfectly with the watch using my phone/tablet. If the scanned app doesn't work for you, go grab the one I mentioned and you will be all set. 100% all notifications push for the Android. I do not own Apple products to test for you sorry. Also, this app has a 'scan' feature. If you have trouble using in combo with a headset, just check on Scan, and choose your watch. Probably got switched to your headset when it connected. Done.UPDATE: TRULY SmartDevice app allows the install of weather applet. Works great. Wish there were more applets!# Construction of this watch is top notch. Metal housing, plastic back and face/screen, and magnetic charger make this look and feel first rate. Lots of compliments in the first two days of wear. Not a flawed bevel or 'squeezable' creaky seam to be found.UPDATE: I have really put this poor thing through its paces lately and it has stood up to some real abuse. Heavy rain, got beaten against a door frame several times hauling equipment around, wasn't paying attention scrubbing up and completely doused it in the sink (at which point it powered off by itself and I thought I had fried it! Dried it off and it has worked ever since.), etc. Still works like a champ.# Bluetooth connectivity is great. What's that mean? I mean it is solid. Stable. Great range. Freaky range actually. I have a PLT_Legend Headset which has amazing range, and I will hear 'beep... phone 1 disconnected' right before I start feeling my wrist vibrate to warn me it is losing signal. Works great with headsets by the way.# Charged this on the first day in about 1.5 hours from 'low battery' warning to full charge. I have been playing around with it quite a bit, playing music, taking and making calls with it for fun, and I get a LOT of messages, emails, skype, case notifications via specialized apps, etc. as a contractor just in regular use.UPDATE: I am changing this to an average of 3 days. You will get anywhere from 2 to 4+ days depending on how much it gets used. Really, it is up to you how much life you get out of it, but either way - you'll never have to worry about battery life. It's incredible.# No battery draining extras. This is what it is: A Smart Watch. No SIM card slot, No TF slot, nothing. Just give you notifications and has a few nice apps like Pedometer and such that seem to work ok. I've tested it all (aside from 'Siri' since I don't own Apple stoofs) and it all appears to work as it should.# Sound is simply fantastic. If CNPGD is good at anything - this seems to be it. Louder than any name brand watch I've messed with, crystal clear, and music reproduction is pretty amazing. Outright enjoyable to listen to in fact. Microphone works well according to the several people I tested it with.# The wristband is very nice quality. The underside is an almost suede texture making it very comfortable to wear, but read on to see one nit-pick that you should know about below.-> Lastly, there are a couple of things you should know before buying just in case any of these might be a deal breaker for you:# If you have large wrists, you will have to buy a longer wristband. I have what I would consider medium to even smallish wrists for a man. I am using the *last* hole on the band and I mean it is exactly comfortable. Any shorter and I wouldn't be able to wear it.UPDATE: Most moto360 bands can be modified to use with this. Leather bands are super easy to just widen the gap a bit. Metal bands are pretty simple to just use band itself and set pins - most of the link gaps are wide enough.# If you are partial to a digital display (i.e. large numbers displayed like 12:15 PM instead of an analog clock) then this will not work for you. There are 5 different watch faces, all of them are nice in their own way and a couple of them are downright amazing. However I am surprised there is no 'digital watch' option for viewing the time. Keep this in mind when ordering.UPDATE: This remains my only gripe, although it is not an issue since a couple of the faces I really like as it is.Overall, I am really enjoying this watch so far and will give regular updates as time goes on just as I did with my previous CNPGD watch. I will miss it dearly as it served me without fail for over a year's brutal abuse by my person. It's final accidental crunch under my foot gives way to this new adventure.UPDATE: So far this watch is every bit the gem my previous model was. I'm really on board with CNPGD products at this point. Bang for your buck, this is hard to beat.",6.0

I ordered and paid for the phone because I needed a ""NO CONTRACT VERIZON PHONE"" to replace one my mother-in law broke. She is currently on my Verizon account, and I am currently under contract with Verizon. The model number and ESN tag on the phone Global Distributing sent me is obviously not the original tag, and has been replaced at some point in time. Regardless Verizon cannot activate phone, and says the tag on phone actually identifies it to be a Motorola phone.I have tried repeatedly and futilely to contact Global Distributing at (208) 391-5347 (phone number is number published under seller's information, and is also number given to me by Amazon's customer service). I have tried for 5 days to contact Global Distributing, and have left several specific voice messages on their Google phone service. I have yet to receive the courtesy of a return phone call from anybody other than Amazon customer service.After involving Amazon customer service (best most responsive customer service I have ever dealt with), and receiving refund from Amazon I finally received an email from Global Distributing whinging about refuns.Global Distributing needs not to whine to Amazon about refunds, but needs to do the right and proper thing by contacting customers, returning phone calls, and selling proper products. No refund was requested by me, but was the last resort since Global Distributing refused to return my phone calls. I ordered and paid for this phone on April 6, 2013. It has been 10+ days, and I am no closer to having replacement phone in hand. I am disappointed in the response by Global Distributing. They need to treat their customers like customers.",15.0

394953,"Sony Xperia Z3 Compact D5803 16GB 4G LTE 4.6"" Unlocked GSM Android Smartphone - Black - International Version No Warranty",,244.0,5,"I just received this phone in the mail yesterday and my initial impressions are extremely positive. Although Apple gets a lot of my business (I own a Mac Mini, Macbook Air, iPod and iPad), when it comes to phones, I've always preferred Android, namely Samsung. This is my first Sony phone product and I have to say this is an awesome phone. I'll post an update later after I've had a chance to use the phone some, but, based on first impressions, I'll say that if you don't want an iPhone but still want to buy a high-end smartphone, then look no further than the Xperia Z3 Compact or perhaps the full-size Xperia Z3. Personally, I don't want to carry around a large phablet, and the Z3 Compact's 4.6 inch screen, which is close to the iPhone 6 screen in size, is sufficient for me. Not to mention I have small hands, and this is much comfortable for me to hold than a larger phone.Software-wise, I am discovering that Sony has paid a lot of attention to detail. When I initially plugged the phone into the USB port on my MB Air, my phone screen immediately displayed a prompt to install Sony Bridge transfer software on the phone and also on my computer. It took only a minute or so to install the software and after I launched it, I was presented with an interface that gave me links to all my media (music, photos, etc..), as well as my iTunes playlists and the option to select and sync the items I wanted to the external SD card on my phone. I selected all the music I wanted and hit the sync button on Sony Bridge on my computer and away it went and once done my music will show up in the very nice Sony Walkman app pre-installed on the phone. With my old Samsung S4 Mini, the built-in music player is not as full-featured and I couldn't sync my playlists. I had to rely on a third-party app, Air Sync to do that, and while it worked well enough, I had to do the sync wirelessly, and there were a few songs that Air Sync couldn't copy over from iTunes for various reasons, and also it was very time consuming to sync over wifi since I have a lot of music. I'm a bit old-fashioned in that I prefer connecting my mp3 players directly to my computer to sync my files.Build-quality of the Z3 Compact is excellent. It looks and feels like a premium quality phone.Anyway, those are my initial impressions. I'll come back in a month or so after I've had more time to play with the phone and list all the pros and possible cons that I find.",0.0

If you are in the United States, you cannot register a J2 phone on your account on Samsung.com. This is Amazon.com, so this may be important for US residents. This phone has a Region Lock. It says to call anywhere for 5+ minutes to unlock the Region Lock. I am on my way to Europe, so this is a very annoying needless step, that cost me $20 to get a SIM and Minutes. The phone works in the US. Android works. BUT, in the US, we consumers demand transparency. Opening the box, and having the flyer fall out with the ""Region Lock"" info, was frightening. Not being able to register the product on Samsung.com means 1) I can't register it, and 2) obtaining ""warranty"" service might be non-existent, according to the US Samsung call center representative. At that point, the $138 might mean I bought a ""disposable"" phone.Update May 9 2016: I did use the phone service in the US for the required 5+ minutes in order to meet the requirements of the Region Lock.

Battery life is awesome.I use t-mobile and since I have wifi at home and work I don't need a data plan. I do have the $1.99 per MB of data service on my plan and if you have that then the phone will use tiny amounts of data to give you email alerts. After 5 days of being always on it has used 0.2 MB so I am looking at $2 or $4 a month for email alerts.The operating system is very primitive but the calendar (that syncs with outlook, but a USB cable is required, no wifi sync) and email (I use multiple accounts with gmail no problem) are both good. I got an 8 gb memory card so I could use it as an mp3 player. The thing in the middle looks like a track pad in the picture but it's just an up/down/left/right switch. There is no gps and really no useful apps to download for it. It does let you check facebook alerts easily if you are in to that but I used the space to always display the current date.If you want a phone with incredibly awesome battery life that lets you check your email, carry your schedule, and doesn't lock you in to an expensive plan for two years then this is the phone to get.",9.0

At the moment, in April 2016, I still have it but it's much slower still. It seems to stall for a few seconds when doing simple things -- touching any icon to launch an app, trying to snap a pic, trying to enter a web address or search item into the browser search field (the keyboard takes several seconds to come up). It's unfair they seem to go noticeably wonky after just a few months of use, especially after the price paid. The camera issues started in under 6 months.I've removed one star because I don't think these phones should degrade so quickly with controlled to moderate use.--Quad core is the way to go. This thing moves fast! The touch sensitivity is very good, apps and internet function smoothly and very quickly (internet might depend on your mobile data service, or wifi quality). And I can attest, from personal experience, that the water-resistant feature WORKS WELL! -- I had a bit of an accident, where the phone was in water for a few seconds, but was back to normal after drying.

121521,BLU Energy X Plus Smartphone - With 4000 mAh Super Battery- US GSM Unlocked - Silver,BLU,139.0,4,"First off, the deal on this phone is absolutely incredible especially for someone who has used go phones in the past. Now for the actual review. I have had this phone for about a week now and I have very very very few complaints. This is especially impressive considering the fact that I only dropped $119 dollars including tax on a smartphone. What BLU is doing, taking flagship technology and putting it in affordable smartphones, is brilliant! The thing I love the most about this phone though, is the gigantic battery that fits inside this device, and the phone is still incredibly thin. The operating system is snappy, the camera is good qualitly, and it has a front facing flash which is always a plus. My first minor complaint is that I wish the phone was LTE compatible. This isn't that big of a deal because you are paying such a low price for the device, it doesn't really matter. Plus, the phone is capable of using dual sims which would compensate for the lack of speed if you were really that worked about it. Regardless, the 4G is relatively fast on the phone. However, I have noticed the intena on this device is not quite as sensitive as it was on my old phone and has a hard time picking up service in low service areas. Thats really it for major complaints. I was bumbed that Snapchat didn't work on the device, but oh well. Probably best I don't become addicted to my phone anyways. Nonetheless, I would definitely recommend this phone. It is an excellent device and works just as good as any tier 1 one phone like iPhone 6 or galaxy s5. But you are only paying a fraction of the price for this phone. Well worth the buy!",2.0

129747,BLU Life XL - LTE Smartphone - GSM Unlocked - 16GB +2GB RAM - White,BLU,622.9,4,"After using this phone for a couple of weeks I raised my rating from three to four stars, basically because I found a bunch of workarounds. Overall, this is a good - even very good - phone for the price, depending what you want to do with it. Just make sure you order the 16/2 not the 8/1 memory configuration. It's only ten bucks more but twice the memory, duh.So here are some workarounds:(1) poor documentation. If you've handled smart phones all your life you won't care about this, if not ask your closest teenage relative.(2) very poor audio from the speaker - it is mono, and you can't hear it no matter how high you crank the volume. The earbuds suck too. My workaround was to get a cheap but totally different pair of buds that actually fit ok inside my ears.(3) camera is pretty good for casual photos outdoors in sunlight, if you (3a) peel off the plastic layer [undocumented] on the lens cover, and (3b) set the shutter delay = 1 or 2 sec, to avoid camera shake. Camera sucks in low light, and there is no optical zoom. If you are taking museum or long-lens photos I would seriously not recommend it, otherwise you may be happy.(4) JPG Photos straight from the camera are _not_ compatible with Photoshop 5.0 LE (get a segment length error). You have to ""export"" them first in the BLU photo editor. Which is very annoying to do one photo at a time. (5) Comes preloaded with about two dozen worthless apps.I know that's a lot of negatives, but the positive is the price and, well, the price. It's not like this phone screwed me or anything. If you don't like the negatives, then buy an i-phone for 8x as much.",2.0

It has tons of great features like Google Now and gestures but it's not loaded with a bunch of apps that I won't ever use. I purchased a 32G memory card but it hasn't arrived yet. They recommend that you store all pictures and data on a memory card so that the internal memory can be used for apps.I have Consumer Cellular as a carrier so I just popped in my sim card and the phone and GPS worked great right away. I had to call for help to set up mobile data though. The tech at Consumer Cellular had never heard of this phone and they didn't have a protocol in their system for it but I told him that it was almost identical to the Galaxy S4 and those settings ended up working perfectly.I compared this phone to a coworker's Galaxy and there really are no visible differences. He was seriously impressed and is looking into switching plans as soon as his contract expires. Just FYI, my husband and I pay $70 (including taxes) a month for two phones with 1000 shared minutes, unlimited texts and 500MG data.

270029,Nokia Lumia 820 8GB GSM 4G LTE Windows 8 Smartphone - Black - AT&T - No Warranty,Nokia,99.99,5,"I am loving my new phone. After much searching, reading reviews and comparison shopping I am glad to end up with the Nokia 820. It generally got good reviews and has not disappointed me in any way after a couple of weeks of use. The one thing the reviews made me worry about was that moving up to this full sized smartphone would seemed like I would be carrying a huge brick, I have found that the Nokia 820 phone fits nicely in my front pocket (I am a blue jeans wearing male) and although it is a little bit heavy in the hand it feels very sturdy and well built and doesn't seem like a burden in the pocket.Naturally I have not completely figured out all of the features of my new phone but I have done my best to get to the ones I anticipate using most often. Music, photos and productivity software all works great on the Nokia. The hardware for taking photos have produced really nice images in a variety of settings and lighting conditions. I haven't printed them out yet but they look good on my desktop screen even when I zoom in on small portions of the picture. The music plays nicely on my headphones and the speaker is acceptable but a little quiet. The loud speaker plays best when placed on a hard surface but if you really want to listen without headphones I recommend getting some external speakers. The music apps preloaded worked great and everything was instantly responsive.This is my first full feature smartphone and so I was not tied into any of the OS ecosystems that are out there. Since I use Microsoft Windows in my work setting it was a relatively easy thing to learn the Windows phone layout. In fact learning new things about my phone has actually increased the usefulness of my home and work computers as I starting syncing more and more of my data across devices. From the productivity standpoint I am now totally sold on the usefulness of this smartphone. I regularly use my e-mail, OneNote and Skydrive accounts throughout my day and have found that the phone seamlessly keeps everything up to date.Speaking of Apps...now I understand why people make such a big deal about the limits of the Windows app store. It isn't like there aren't a ton of apps to choose from but often you start with a web page that you use a lot and then get the mobile app. If that app isn't supported you could go out and find something similar but it just isn't the same. You often have invested time and energy in the original web site and so it feels like a loss to start over with a different app. I don't think this will be a big deal with me but I can see it frustrating people who are more tied to their apps. The phone works great with the apps it has available but you might look to see if your favorite cookbook, movie streaming service or bird app is available for Windows phone if you are choosing which OS you want to live with.Finally and probably most importantly for the supplier of my phone, I would highly recommend purchasing through these guys. They shipped my phone incredibly quickly and provided the exact product described. The unlocked phone naturally comes from overseas and they sent a plug adapter along with it so it was immediately functional. (Quick note: even though my phone was marked for sale in Saudi Arabia, absolutely everything works in good 'ol American English and all the standard apps and features were present from the moment I turned it on.) I had a some questions about the phone and the suppliers replied within half a day if not faster - even on the weekend!",8.0

I do have the $1.99 per MB of data service on my plan and if you have that then the phone will use tiny amounts of data to give you email alerts. After 5 days of being always on it has used 0.2 MB so I am looking at $2 or $4 a month for email alerts.The operating system is very primitive but the calendar (that syncs with outlook, but a USB cable is required, no wifi sync) and email (I use multiple accounts with gmail no problem) are both good. I got an 8 gb memory card so I could use it as an mp3 player. The thing in the middle looks like a track pad in the picture but it's just an up/down/left/right switch. There is no gps and really no useful apps to download for it. It does let you check facebook alerts easily if you are in to that but I used the space to always display the current date.If you want a phone with incredibly awesome battery life that lets you check your email, carry your schedule, and doesn't lock you in to an expensive plan for two years then this is the phone to get.",9.0
399038,Sony Xperia Z5 Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - Gold,Sony,599.99,5,"I'm a big gamer, and I don't need to go over those features for you for the thousandth time, but after deciding not to upgrade to the Sony Xperia Z3 or Z3+ due to the heating issues, and a couple other reasons, I drooled over the Xperia Z5 specs for months waiting to buy this phone in the U.S. with a warranty. I finally got it through Amazon, and this phone is absolutely blazing fast! However the number the Sony Guy provided me to purchase an additional warranty didn't pan out, I still feel this phone deserves a full 5 star review. The camera, the graphics, the power, The playstation integration for gamers, this phone is exactly what I have been waiting for to upgrade for my trusty Xperia Play R800 and I couldn't be happier. Unless of course it slid out into a PlayStation controller like the old R800's but the display, camera, and about everything else make this phone so vastly superior in every aspect. I'm not even mad the U.S. version didn't get a finger print scanner as there is a ton of apps for that, and that wasn't a selling point anyways for me. I am in love all over again with another great Xperia!",13.0

396064,Sony Xperia Z3 Plus E6533 32GB Black Dual Sim Unlocked International GSM model - No Warranty,Sony,303.99,4,"So I purchased this one from Perfect Trading Inc, and it arrived in a seal pack condition. Though I had to waste half an hour to set up as it came in with all defaults set and that too in some Chinese language. Therefore I had to find my way through language settings and then restored it. Doing that allowed me to get to all the initial settings as it should prompt for when you turn it on for the first time. Along with this the charger that came with it was European plug. The nice thing about this was it came pre-installed with screen protector. Plus it also had Sony ear-phones in the box. Also to all who are curious; Yes it does HEAT a lot and drains battery heavily. In order to take care of the heating issue, Sony has disabled 2 cores of CPU in the OTA update, hence making it very similar to SnapDragon 805 and 801. But the heating issue is still there after the update as well.",40.0

398990,Sony Xperia Z5 Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - Gold,Sony,599.99,5,"Coming from a Galaxy S3 (with Zerolemon extended battery) that lasted 3+ years, the difference between the two phones is night and day. Definitely larger, less curvy, and thinner. The Z5 feels very premium if not a little on the fragile side. I've heard reports in the past (especially with the Z3) of the screens self-cracking, so I wasn't going to take any chances with this phone. I also ordered a tempered glass screen protector and a clear TPU case and threw those on before anything else.It's only been a few days, and these are my observations thus far:Spent the first two days playing with the Z5 and updating it. An update was available right out of the box. This can be done either through the phone itself or by connecting it to the computer and installing Sony's Xperia Companion software (which I didn't mind.) There were a lot of features to play with. Won't be getting bored any time soon. One thing to note: the volume buttons are on the lower-right side of the phone, as opposed to the Galaxy S3's upper-left side. It takes some getting used to. Some have said that it's simply poor placement, but it's really not that bad. It might be annoying if you're right-handed, but I could see left-handers having an easier time. It's left-hander friendly! And for the record, I could care less about the lack of fingerprint scanner support. I don't think it's a needed feature, and definitely not a deal-breaker. My S3 didn't have one, so I don't believe I'm missing out.Today was my first real day of having it in my pocket while at work. I don't wear tight pants, but the phone is thinner than what I'm used to, so I remained aware of the potential of it bending in my pocket. I charged the phone overnight to 100%. As of this writing (around 4:13 PM), I'm down to 76%. Granted, I wasn't using the camera heavily or playing any games yet or had the screen on for a prolonged period of time. But as it stands, I can easily get two days out of this thing.Here's something of interest: I guess Android 6.0 has a feature called ""Double-tap to Wake"", where you can simply double-tap the display and it'll come on so you can unlock the device from there. Very nice feature! I always think that I'm wearing down the power button with the constant screen turning on and off. BUT, over the course of the work day and having the phone in my pocket, I noticed on two occasions that the flashlight mode was shining in my pocket. Somehow, it enabled itself in my pocket and I know I locked the device. I also noticed that my bluetooth was on, and I had no recollection of turning that on as well. I suspect that the ""Double-tap to Wake"" feature is so sensitive that it's turning on in my pocket, sliding around, and sliding the notification bar down and pressing random settings off and on. Even in my pocket, the screen must be very sensitive! There's apparently a ""Glove mode"" that makes it easier to interact with the screen while wearing gloves. This mode was turned off. I've since turned off the ""Double-tap to Wake"" feature. I'll report back if I'm still having issues with this.",6.0

Sound quality was good but the navigation around this phone is bad thing that just kills what could have been a great little phone.

272830,Nokia Lumia 920 32GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Windows 8 Smartphone - Red,Nokia,149.35,5,"I've been wanting this Windows phone since its release and have finally plop down the money for one. First of all, the type: Nokia Lumia 920 unlocked white International version (RM-821). The biggest difference between international version RM-821 and AT&T's RM-820 is that AT&T's RM-820 is locked (need to get unlock code from AT&T) and AT&T's version support AT&T's 4G network. Since I use this with pay as you go on AT&T network, I usually turn the data OFF unless I really need it (rare). My RM-821 does see AT&T 3G, AT&T LTE 1 Lumia and AT&T LTE 2 Lumia. The biggest advantage of RM-821 over AT&T's branded version is ... whatever updates Nokia/Microsoft announces, you get immediately instead of waiting for AT&T to get theirs. eg. I got the GDR2/Amber update way before official AT&T version get theirs.The phone itself:Beautiful. The screen is bright, the back side is shiny, and it holds nicely in my hand. 32 GB of memory means I'm not fighting for space between my music, photos, videos and apps. It's a bit heavy/big (according to my wife) but I love the weight and size (4.5"") comparing to my previous (Nokia 710 : Windows Phone 7.8) I was debating if I want to pay an extra $100 bucks for the 925 or $800 bucks for the unlocked 1020. The 1020 looks awesome but $800 bucks unlocked (or $609 on AT&T) is a bit steep. 925 looks nice but 16GB RAM is a deal breaker. Most Amazon vendor sells Lumia 920 for about $350 - $360. I've also thought about the 820, which has micro SD slot but with a lower end camera, display and 8GB RAM, the 920 is worthy of their price.The camera:This is one of the main reason I got this phone: the PureView technology 8.7MP is awesome in low light! Go try it at a retail store that has it on display and you'll know what I mean. GDR2 update brings Nokia Pro Cam into the mix, allowing you to quickly mess with ISO, white balance, shutter speed, manual focus, and exposure compensation if you wish. Love the slide to zoom option (even in video!). The location of the camera is a bit too toward the middle since my finger sometimes gets in the way; I guess I just need to hold it the right way :pProcessor:Feels pretty snappy since it was the flag ship phone. Lumia 925/928/1020 all uses the same processor.Wireless charging:I haven't had the chance to play with this so you'll have to read other people's review for that one.NFC:I was looking forward to this since most Android phones can share photos via NFC. I've tried it with a Nexus 7 and no dice. I looked online and noticed that Android's implementation is different than Windows 8 ... so the sharing of photos/video is only possible Nokia to Nokia and Android to Android. You CAN, how ever share URLs and contacts (remember to do the share, choose tab+send)Maps:Offline maps is one of the reason I love this phone (Nokia in general) since you can download the map ahead of time and not worry about having data access to use the GPS option.Apps:Windows store may not have as many apps as iOS or Android, it has enough for me. There are only so many apps one can consume before you see variations of an idea. If it's a concern for you, go search the Windows Phone Store for apps before you buy a Windows phone.Sync:Yeah. People complained about this online because Microsoft is moving away from Zune for Desktop. To get your stuff synced between your PC and your phone, I use Zune to organize the music/video/photo/playlist and ""Windows Phone app for Desktop"" to do the syncing. It's clumsy but it works for me.Update on Sync: (10/18/2013)The playlist still messes up from time to time. One thing that works is: once you connect your phone, it's treated like a USB thumb drive device. To muck with the play list (correctly):1. have ""Windows Phone app for Desktop"" sync the music you want2. use File browser to navigate to whatever-you-name-your-phone\Phone\Music\Playlist (you need to enable ""Show Hidden files, folders, and drives"" if you stay with Microsoft defaults)3. right click on a playlist (something you need to create in Zune) and choose ""Properties""4. Click on the ""References tab"" and it will show you the songs in the playlist5. To add songs, drag existing songs on your phone to the playlistOver all, it's a solid phone, I've grown to like Windows tiles and apps are on the increase.",2.0

It isn't too bright, and the colors do not really pop out - but, better than most phones at the price range. The phone does operate a little slow as it operates off 3G, and even though it advertises that it can be upgraded to Android Lollipop, I did not see that as being available on the phone. But for the price, this phone blows others in this same range out of the water. I did notice I was missing a few things in my box - a detailed instruction manual, and the cord that connects to the plug in power adapter...but, luckily for me, I my adapter from my old phone fits this one, and the phone itself is pretty simple to get the hang of. I wish there were some phone cases for this. The phone did come with a phone case, but it isn't one that will really protect the phone in case I drop it. I have looked all over for a phone case, and there is not much of a selection. My recommendation for Blu is to come out with some cool phone cases like Otter boxes! Other than that, this phone is pretty cool.",2.0

So if you're accustomed to the fast-charge cable that comes with the S7 edge (as is my phone), it does not charge that quickly. Also, worth pointing out for people who may not be aware, the S7 edge, and preceeding models, have a small area within where the wireless charging connects to the phone.

Horrible GUI, and a somewhat lackluster degree of organization. I think my Shih Tzu might have been able to create something more tasteful (ah, but I jest, she is merely a dog).Now, for the actual review. This phone is solid. I have dropped it, easily, thirty or more times, and it has yet to break! I was afraid that the pivoting design might be very delicate, but, having owned this phone for nearly four whole months, and having dropped, thrown, and scratched it a whole lot, it is still running strong.The only downside to the hardware is that the back doesn't really seem too well thought out, which is unusual for a Nokia device.Overall, but it, love it, show it to your friends, your mom, and everyone who walks by and says ""IS THAT A PHONE?!?!?"", and than proceeds to grab your phone and oogle and drool over it.

The cost of the phone is very reasonable and I was able to get a case for the phone from one of those small phone business stores. The only challenge I have with the phone is the low volume during phone conversations. Also, while scrolling through my contacts, the phone mistakenly dials contacts because it is highly sensitive to touch.

For this price, the tablet should not easily tip over when in the most upright stand position. For iPad versions, the stand grips the corners, but for this Note 10.1 version, there are no corner grips and the stand has holds on each side, about 1/2 inch away from the corners, where the tablet just sits in the grooves with no locking features. This means it tips over easily with too much stylus or finger pressure. There also is no way to set tablet up vertically using the stand provided. There are two horizontal positions only.I've adapted. I brought this because I dropped my first tablet and broke the glass.Just don't think because you're paying $89 bucks you're getting all that you need in a case because you're not.

I had been using two phones, one for work (iPhone) and one for personal use (Samsung Galaxy) and was looking for a dual sim phone so I could stop carrying two phones. This phone has not disappointed. I was able to pop my two sims in and within seconds, I was up and running with one device with two different phone numbers and data plans. All the same apps I was running one my other phones have been installed and are working great. I saw many reviews disappointed in the battery life, but I've had no problems. I'm not a gamer and don't watch a ton of videos, but after a 14 hour work day of ""my normal use"" which involves a few calls, several text and a lot of time online, I still have around 20% battery at the end of the day. The phone feels like it's well built. The finger print scanner is much faster than my galaxy. I like that I can set the phone to use a specific sim for specific task or allow it to ask me each time. Other phones I've seen only allow you to use one sim at a time. This phone uses both sims at the same time. The screen looks great, the camera is great and it's hands down the fastest between the three phones, You also can't beat the internal storage of 64gb, which you can expand with a microSD. For the already great price you also get two phone covers and the micro USB to USB adapter which would cost you another $100 if you bought separately. So far... very happy with this phone.",4.0
376359,Samsung Galaxy Y GT-S5360t Unlocked GSM Quadband Phone - Grey(International Version No Warranty),,84.0,5,"I just bought this phone to use as my ""travel abroad"" phone. I needed a 3G Quadband Unlocked phone so I could pick up inexpensive prepaid voice/data sim cards during my travels and not get clobbered with roaming fees. This phone is perfect. It is inexpensive, has most of the important bells and whistles of Android, and just works. It even runs Netflix streaming, though a bit jerky. Talking GPS works great too. I agree with another reviewer that stated it would be a great alternative to an IPOD touch. Even on WiFi without the sim card installed, the phone pretty much was fully functional (obviously no voice). But the best part of all is the built in tethering feature. You can activate the phone so that the phone can share its data service with other devices (with security and encryption if desired). This was vital for me as I need a ""connected"" laptop in these out of the way places. I agree with other reviewers' comments about the small screen and more basic nature of the camera. But at the $120 price point, this phone is a steal!A note regarding my seller ""Open Group Wireless."" I ordered from the Northeast US on Thursday evening and it came in the US mail (FedEX smartpost) Saturday with my regular delivery. The phone appears to be designed for the UK market as the power adapter had the unique UK style plugs. This didn't bother me at all as 1) the package also included a US style converter plug (in the factory sealed box), and 2) the phone uses the now standard MicroUSB style connector. Most cell phones (and Nooks, Kindles, etc.) use this standard. I have tons of these chargers and in the car. They are super cheap an ubiquitous these days anyway. I would also note that the package from Open Group Wireless came with English instructions (though the phone came with default settings of British English, a quick fix) which is consistent with comments from other reviewers and of course the style of power adapter. Also very important, the sealed package came with a 2GB MicroSD card (with full size SD adapter branded by Samsung). Some other reviewers complained about the lack of an included SD card, but mine came with one. Don't know if this is vendor specific.In summary, I could not be happier, especially for the price paid. I hope Samsung keeps making them!",5.0

My second Huawei phone and the quality of their products has only gotten better imo. The design and build quality of this phone makes the jet black iphone look ordinary and the battery life makes the iphone look pathetic. I don't mind the EMUI that much, but am a real fan of Google Now, so went straight to that launcher. The settup was pretty easy, though it did not simply mirror my apps and settings from my other phone, so I had to download and install my favorite apps one at a time. Since the phone is so fast, that did not take much time and it gave me the chance to explore settings and features while I was doing the tasks. Camera results are superb though I have much more to learn about the options and features provided. Signal strength for both wifi and network are the best I've had in my rural local. So far I'm totally pleased with this item and found a case I really like, though I'd much rather use the phone without a case. That is not, however, a practical every day option. Drops could be fatal with so much glass exposed. I'll update more here if I change my point of view, but for now this is a winning choice for my needs and taste.",1.0
219024,LG G3 D855 16GB (FACTORY UNLOCKED) - No 4G in USA - International Version No Warranty (Gold),,349.99,5,"First off, I've bought 5 smartphones in the last five months.. It's weird I know. This phone trumps them all, in an odd way. I'll explain. This is not the best feeling phone I've had (the One M7 or the LG G2 would be) and its not the most feature filled phone (Sony Xperia Z1 compact would be)But all around with everything and every area thought about, it is my favorite. The screen on this phone is amazing.. you'll read a ton of reviews on how it's not noticeable or how its not worth the battery drain.. They are all wrong. This screen is absolutely beautiful, and my battery life lasts 2 days with how I use the phone. One thing that is lame about the screen is allot of Apps are not optimized for QHD so for instance my bank app is huge and doesn't fit in the screen, small beans tho on an otherwise perfect screen.The speed is great.. the 801 SoC is crazy fast and the phone never heats up.. At first tho with Lg Health and smart alerts enabled the phone did have noticeable lagg.. that was all fixed with disabling them. You are for sure future-proof for the time being with this SoC and QHD screenThe build is nice.. its sturdy and has a nice weight.. I loved the feel of the G2 though. The G2 wins in the build department but it's stock software was atrocious.. there was even spelling errors all over the place in that mess of a UI. I got a Spigin case and a .2mm ICarez tempered glass screen protector and I enjoy them both.The double tap to turn screen on and off is great and i love the lock-screen knock code.This phone also gets UPDATES DIRECT FROM LG.. so put simply you get the latest version of android right when it's out.. no waiting for Verizon or T-mobile to spend 3 months ruining android. Right when I pulled my phone out of the box it updated to Lollipop 5.0 which is awesome.I will have this phone for a long time.. it has finally stopped my cycle of buying a new phone monthly. I'd recommend it to anyone.. just buy a screen protector (glass) and case quickly because this phone is expensive and it needs both. This varient comes with 2 gigs of system RAM so if thats not enough go with the 32Gig version that has 3 g's of Ram.Love the phone and will never be able to go back to 1080p oh yeah, the camera on this thing is Iphone quality and that's saying something.EDIT 4-2-15: If I could go back and do it all over again I'd get the 32Gig variant of this phone as it has 3 gigabytes of RAM. The 2 gigs in this phone is just not enough to handle this phones specs. I've had to disable all of the cool features I bought the phone for due to the lack of RAM. I'm going to keep this phone as a backup But have ordered a OnePlus One. The OnePlus is an amazingly fast phone and will better suit my needs. If you aren't a power user this version of the G3 should be more than enough. For me sadly, it is not.",1.0

I use a prepaid phone and primarily use it when traveling or out of the house as a ""emergency"" phone friends kept nagging me that they wanted me to text or send pics so enter Verykool. so far it IS just that and I have sent texts and photos. BTW the camera seems excellent and I WILL probably be using the phone more because of it.UPDATE I received it on 6/3 I had enjoyed it so my hubby said get me one Went to the listing and the price had changed from $79.99 to $62.46 that is a sizeable reduction SO I attempted to contact verykool no where to find them on Amazon SO I went to their web site and sent a letter on Sun 6/5 regarding the change in price and could I get a adjustment or did I have to jump through hoops and return to to buy it cheaper.

This is a replacement for my daily driver and I have to say I am truly impressed by OnePlus and how they've managed to put flagship specs on a $300 phone. It is an outstanding phone for the price. The build quality is amazing. The battery is great, so far I've managed to get around 4 hours of screen on time with a fairly dim lit screen, something I was not able to achieve on my MXPE. However, it will depend on how you use your phone and what setting you are comfortable with, nevertheless, the device has outstanding battery, more than enough to last you the day. The only downside, for me at least, is the lack of fast charging. I don't mind it, but it would have been a reasonable addition, considering this is a USB-C device. The USB-C is only convenient for convenience sake. It does not really do all that much to change your experience. Overall, this is a great phone for someone who is looking for low-priced alternative to the MXPE, or other mid-range flagship.

I am more than pleased with the Moto G4 Plus so far and it is not as big as I feared (though I would never call it small, especially to its face). For the price, I just don't see how you can find a better end user experience. The OS is speedy, the camera is more than capable, comes with almost zero bloatware, and probably has more storage space than I'll ever need. I paid for the 64 GB version because I wanted the 4 GB RAM to help ensure I don't have issues with lag both now and down the road, and the extra $ seems to be totally worth it.",15.0

This is a very nice and easy to use gadget. Most other watch/phones you have to install the memory card in the same compartment as the SIM card . But this one has the TF card slot on the side of the watch next to the charging/USB port. I really like that. Under a hundred bucks you really can't go wrong.

It functions flawlessly and is more stable than my big name brand Samsung ever was!!! The battery lasts ALL day! Simply put I am amazed at this phone. The only tiny complaint that I have is its inability to accept a 64gb micro SD card but that has really been a non issue anyway.I just can't say enough for such an affordable phone. I've had it for over a month now and it's well built, functions flawlessly, the screen is outstanding, and the battery life is great!!!",19.0

I was able to purchase a tracfone micro-sim card and the phone works flawlessly. I also upgraded with a 64GB memory card and it works great. This was my original opinionHOWEVER...THEN The 3.5mm headphone jack quit working. The sound was very distorted. I looked on line on how I could fix it and was recommended to use an alcohol wipe with a straightened paperclip to clean the 3.5mm port. I did this an it worked...FOR A SHORT TIME. I thought I had somehow allowed dirt/grime/whatever to get into this jack. But the second time it quit working I was listening to it, Was working fine, then it just went out. Exact same distorted sound issue. I tried cleaning it, with no luck. I have found no way to fix this. Also, there is absolutely no support for an international Samsung phone.A phone without the ability to get sound out of a 3.5mm jack is ALMOST USELESS. Sure, I can use a blue tooth headset for calls and a blue tooth speaker for sound, but that isn't allowed on an airplane. All other functions work, just not the 3.5mm headphone jack. So I am downgrading my previous 5-star to a 2-Star with the warning: DO NOT BUY THE INTERNATIONAL VERSION OF THIS PHONE!",2.0

As a former android user and a college student, Window phone is great. android is great too, but the apps can be overwhelming sometimes...this is really helping me manage my time well. 950xl is great in most areas you need it for. Most of the apps you might need are available. If you're entrenched in google's ecosystem like I am it can be a little hard, but you'll get used to it. I like W10, its fluid. No lagging whatsoever, the battery is great a single charge throughout the day, the back camera is good, but the selfie cam is not the best, and the display is beautiful. The phone is customizable to a good degree, I haven't figured it all out. It has the S7 glance screen, it has LG's knock knock feature, the iris scanner is on point, even in dark spaces it recognise my iris, Cortana reads your text if you have Bluetooth headphone on, this comes in handy when I'm biking ...apps like camscanner and mystudylife and lots of other useful app is in the store. The US states and other country's map can be downloaded for offline navigation, but only driving and walking navigation, New York's MTA map is not there, ( I'm a lil sour about that since I mostly take the train). there are many more features, In my opinion, if you really want to spend less time on unnecessary apps, but take note, set reminders/calendars text and call, play a few games and listen to music. this is a great phone.P.S: I've had it for a month now.I have a small android tablet for my bank apps and some other apps for conveniency...and khan academy",0.0

The phone itself feels premium, this coming from using an iPhone for the last 2 years. The hardware is there (has a great camera and screen) and it has some neat features (iris recognition to unlock your phone, when connected to your car via Bluetooth Cortana is very helpful and lets you speech to text respond to the person who just texted you easily), the only reason its not getting 5 stars is because the software and App support is still... sadly, lacking. Apps just don't look good like they do on IOS or Android and lack features that the other competitors have. Maybe in the next few months Microsoft can fix this and improve bugs.

I did a lot of research to ensure this model would work best on their network. It appears that most/ (maybe all) GSM phones with work world-wide on other GSM networks. However, from my research, it seems as though not every GSM phone will with perform as well as the ""branded"" models that are designed for use on their networks. This appears to especially hold true for what data speed you can potentially connect with i.e., 3G maximum or 4G LTE service.I ordered a new phone and that is exactly what I got. It still had the protective film over all the ports, etc. and the phone clock only had a few minutes of QC test-time on it. It came with a battery, wall charger, ear-buds and instructions. I did have to go to the AT&T store to have them install a micro-SIM because my old phone used the mini-SIM so I could not simply swap it out between the two phones.Overall this a very nice high-end phone. Fast, with a crisp & clear screen. Seems to be working fine on my network and it connects to the LTE signals when I'm in range of those cell towers.",9.0

So I bit the bullet and ordered the E7. Let me tell you up front it is a very attractive design with a stunning screen viewable outside even with the brightness set on low; many times i have been astounded by the wonderful visibility of its Clear Black AMOLED Display and the 4 inch screen makes a big difference for me in comfort and usability.I do not want to waste time rehashing info clearly described in other reviews so lets get to the meat of the situation:1 -If you take any type of up close / macro shots on a regular basis you will be terribly disappointed. The camera is just not good for that type of imagery. All other photography is great in most well lit situations even with out great lighting you can get decent shots.2 - The Wifi is quite finicky on these phones so you maybe reconnecting a bit (OK, a lot!). I thought it was just my unit but it seems many users are having this issue. It's not bad enough for me to not want to use the phone but it might be for you.Nokia really screwed the pooch on this magnificent phone; just adding a 5mp auto focus camera would have been sufficient and not cannibalized the N8 sales. The Wifi issue is not that big for me and could probably be easily resolved with firmware.I am writing this for people who already know about the Symbian OS and understand its strengths and limitations. I believe Symbian Belle is a very good OS and a pleasure to use; Iphone and Android zombies might not be appreciative of any Symbian phone regardless.",

I don't know how my usage might compare to others, but I use Facebook and email frequently throughout the day, have tried out the GPS navigation a couple of times, used Google Music, surfed a bit of news, and played Words With Friends. The display is the biggest battery drain I think, so I keep that down pretty low all the time. I don't do much talking, hence getting the plan with only 100 minutes, so I can't say how much battery is affected by talk time.Only a couple of gripes... As others have mentioned, the beep when the battery is charged is annoying. I charge my phone by my bed at night and I still want to be able to receive emergency calls and texts so I'm not going to put it on silent in order to avoid that beep. But it does wake me up. Still, I can live with it.Sometimes texts fail to send and I've seen other people in forums with this problem too. Also the texting app is glitchy and doesn't always respond to your taps in the text area to bring up the keyboard.Yes, the back cover is as slippery as everyone else says. I bought the gel skin case for the Galaxy W (same phone as the Exhibit II, just rebranded outside the US) and I'm so glad I did. I would certainly have dropped the phone repeatedly by now if I didn't have the skin.Overall, I highly recommend this phone. Excellent price for $200, especially if you're been holding out for a while for the price of smart phones and data plans to drop.",5.0

The camera it amazing but does make pictures very bright, low light is fantastic and focus is fast and sharp, you get way more than what you pay for.Speakers: The dual stereo speakers are loud and clear. I have to turn the phone down in order to make my ringer not be heard by the neighbors.Screen: Screen is full 1440 and the refresh rate is high end. While watching videos you'll be able to see pores on faces just fine and very fluid movement.1 Handed Ability: The Built-In keyboard is great but swipe prediction is very pore. This does have very good one handed support. But I recommend replacing the Keyboard app with something that has better prediction if you're a swipe user.Network: Although this phone has LTE bands built in; the older bands that most companies offer in little to smaller areas are not supported. This phone is made with the newer bands that most companies are upgrading towers to provide. So if someone does get this phone and the newer band is not in your area you'll have either H+ or 4G (refer below). Not to worry all the cell companies are working on the upgrades and the LTE bands will become available in your area soon. Refer to your provider for further information. As of now LTE is supported on this phone in most cities, towns, and urban areas depending on service. I recommend a service sunning on AT&T towers. Until T-Mobile finishes upgrades on towers, LTE is very limited and may continue to be limited due to no support for Band 12. (Although there is band 4 which is T-Mobiles dominate.)Note: This phone was said to be getting Marshmallow but for now we have a stock version of Lollipop. No set date has been announced for the update.1. E = EDGE/GSM: When getting this sign you are getting the weakest signal for your phone but are still getting non-roaming signal for general calls and text. I advise if this is your areas mane signal strength you have a Wi-Fi signal available for the data internet connection.2. G = 2G/GSM: When the G is showing you are getting remedial signal but still pretty strong. Calls and Text's will be flawless and you will be able to do general internet surfing but you will not be loading any HD videos or have perfect connection to online only game's. With this I recommend a Wi-Fi signal in your house if you plan on using the internet in these areas.3. H = 3G-/HSPA: This signal is classified as 3G but runs a little slower or faster depending on how close you are to the main tower. If you're getting a good amount of bars with signal will do flawless calls, text's, and you'll be able to able to surf the internet and load videos at a max of 480P (320 Resolution is recommend for best result).4. 3G = 3G+/GSM/HSPA: This is the full 3G speed and will be flawless with calls, text's, and be able to stream video like Netflix and Hulu (Recommended 480 Resolution), play online games, and surf the internet fast and easy.5. H+ = 4G-/GSM/HSPA+: This is the signal that most first generation 4G phones use. Perfect for all light movie watchers, and small business people. Flawless calls, text's, and the internet is speedy. H+ although fast has been known to be faulty in a lot of area's and was quickly replaced. If you've got this signal it's still 4G but it's kind of like the EGDE version of 4G. For best results stay in one place when in use as service changes rapidly while moving from place to place. Example using this speed while driving would not be reliable.6. 4G = 4G/GSM/HSPA+: This is the 4G signal that was most used from 2010 to 2012 4G phones use such as the Galaxy S series (Sept for the S4) Although this is a very fast and reliable; it's not as fast as LTE in most areas but for the average person whom just watched movies and plays online games on his/her phone this signal is more than enough to give anyone a crisp fast feel and load HD movies (720P Recommended but not limited to.)7. 4G LTE = 4G+/GSM/LTE: This is the current signal most used. It is lighting fast and is the most reliable for non-stop videos, gaming, and downloading.Disclaimer about BLU Phones: Most BLU Phones are made to have a long shelf like as they are not ready to sell from a store. As such the Battery has never had a full charge. I recommend before turning the phone on to charge it for a full 8 to 12 hours and not to unplug it even if it says full. If you turn the phones on before they are charged fully you risk losing battery memory and suffering pore battery life.NOTICE: Most BLU phones to not auto populate Access Point Names (APN) and in turn when someone puts in the SIM card the service seems to not work or some people will start having issues with picture messaging. Google search your provider for correct APN settings and install them in the phone yourself. This is an issue with most unlocked phones and is very easy to fix.",2.0

Had it in the US for a few weeks at first and it was fine. US cell carrier found it a bit challenging to set up (had to call them) but then it worked OK.Got a local SIM card at the airport when I arrived overseas.Was impressed at the size of the battery compared to the size of the phone and figured it would last well. No so. At first what seemed like normal use would deplete the battery in less than a day. Then got careful about turning off features I wasn't using at the time and re-charging at odd times when convenient and now happy enough with it. In group I'm traveling with I'm usually the one with charge left on her phone when it's time to call a cab in the evening. Have a small external battery pack, too, just in case, too.I really do not like the camera - the quality of the images are way below the middle-of-the-road Motorola phone I had before. I shoot at highest resolution and have attempted to adjust ISO, etc. for conditions. Still, the pics often look muddy and taking them is a real pain because you have to touch in the exact center of the shutter (iris image) button. Missed a lot of shots at first from that.Came with a plastic screen protector (I did not use- got a glass one that Almost fits...) and a plastic case/cover for the back of the phone, which I do use. Problem with the case/cover is the holes for the charger and headset are wrong and I have to pull the case/cover off the top of the phone to fully plug in charger or headset.Performance seems OK. Screen looks great. Like the 16 GB memory standard and the option of adding an SD card.We'll see how it works when I'm back in the States.

Almost 6 months to the day after I purchased this phone the screen stopped working. It wasn't frozen, it just would not respond to any input. I looked at my options with the seller for return and repair. Nothing. I called Samsung twice and they said that they couldn't help me. Samsung said that the phone was from Australia and that I needed to call Samsung in Australia? Really! Anyway, this phone does not come with a factory warranty and if it malfunctions you're out of luck. Samsung did not offer me a repair option even if I were willing to pay for it. So, I'm a little smarter now. First, don't spend this kind of money without getting some kind of warranty. Second, Samsung should be take more responsibility for their product's quality and durability. I understand that Samsung makes millions of phone every year and that a lemmon will sometimes make it to the market but they should take care of customers when that occurs. The Nexus 5x is unlocked, much cheaper and comes with a 1 year warranty and you can buy additional coverage for under $70. I miss a few of the bells and whistles that the s6 had but I love the idea that no matter what the reason, if my Nexus 5x fails I'm covered. But, on the other hand there are a few things that the Nexus is better at then the s6. Consumer Reports gave the s6 a test score of 78 and the Nexus 5x a 77.

Anyway, right off the bat, I LOVE this phone. I looked for over a month, reading reviews, trying to find the perfect phone since my contract was ending (I had a Motorola V3xx). I wanted a smartphone, and thought the iPhone was the way to go...then I found out it had no stereo Bluetooth (unacceptable to me for my next phone), the forced data plan was kinda pricey to be locked into, I didn't like the plastic of the new 3G version, and I heard the battery life wasn't very good. I also read the same about Windows Mobile phones. Then I got to the E71. I'd have to sacrifice the flashy big touch-screen...and I'm so glad I did. To have a phone with a full QWERTY keyboard on a device this thin (instead of a big-brick slider phone), a beautiful steel frame and battery cover, great tactile feedback and domed keys making up for lack of space between them (even with my big thumbs)...it was so worth it.Received it in 2 days, popped in my old SIM card, called up and got an inexpensive unlimited data plan (active as soon as I hung up the phone, turned it off and back on), and was off and running! Web browsing is a blast, e-mailing is great (probably my only complaint with the phone is that I can't SAVE e-mails on it..check for new ones, the old ones disappear..still haven't found a work-around for that yet), there's a ton of freeware out there for the operating system (for AIM/IM programs, even a free voice-guided GPS program I found!), camera is better than the RAZR's (though most do say it's terrible compared to other phones), I've got over 500 songs (any of which can be the ring tone!) on an 8GB card, 4 e-books, and lots of room left...I could go on, but just read other reviews!If you have the opportunity, hold one...that alone may sell you on the thing! I don't regret spending the $$$ on this phone unlocked vs. getting a subsidized phone/new contract...the $$$ I will save on the data plan alone will pay for the difference in a lot less time than a contract would take!",5.0

He liked it enough to buy 3 more for his hired hands.You can't compare this with the Moto X as it's a lower spec phone.

The z1c had the highest build quality in my opinion (the metal casing exuding the appearance of ""high-end""). The z5c is a step down from here, although the performance is updated, the phone does not look or feel high-end in your palm. This isn't a huge deal to me as I primarily use this phone for travel; the small size, waterproofing, and low-key appearance are all assets. However unlike the z1c, I don't enjoy using the z5c at home in the states. One big gripe for me has been the fingerprint scanner. The iPhone will read and unlock my prints 90% of the time, the z5c is probably more like 60% for me. I'm sure experiences will vary.In all its a mediocre phone, but given the choices out there, it is by far the best Android in this size.

389967,Sony Xperia M4 Aqua 16GB GSM/LTE Unlocked Cell Phone - Black (U.S. Warranty),Sony,199.99,1,"The phone itself is not bad, but the customer service from Sony is awful. After a few months of using the phone, the ear piece in the phone stopped working, I called sony and explained the problem, it still worked on speaker, and with the handsfree set in, but not when holding the earpiece to my ear. They insisted it could be a software glitch and had me reset the phone..... twice, which did not work.So I had to send it in for repair, and this is where the fun starts. Having been told it would take about 14 business days to fix and send my phone back, I am currently still waiting and we are on business day 28. To this point, after 4 phone calls, and 3 emails (because one representative actually told me that they didn't have a way to call people at the facility where the repairs take place, true story!), still no-one can tell me when the phone might be fixed.With that in mind, I asked for a replacement phone the last time I contacted them, I felt that was not unreasonable as they were well past their own schedule for repairing and returning my device, and clearly could not give any clue as to when it might be done. They simply ignored that request and said that my phone would be repaired and sent back when they got the parts in. This could be in 6 days, or 6 months.I would not by this product and would recommend people avoid sony products if this is what happens when the slightest thing goes wrong. The support (or lack thereof) is appalling for a company of their size and standing, and it could be a simple fix, if they would just replace a device when they are having so much trouble finding the part they need for it. Instead they are leaving a paying customer hanging, with no recourse, and without the phone paid for.",27.0

183674,Glocalme G1S Global Unlocked Mobile Wi-Fi Hotspot Roaming-Free SIM-Free Support Over 108 Countries with 2GB Initial Global Data Equals 60EUR,Glocalme®,98.99,1,"WARNING! Do not buy! I have had nothing but negative experiences with this product. Let me explain. After loading the 60 euro/2 GB card onto the device, I started trying to connect with our wifi. Instructions that were included with the product said it might take 10 minutes to connect the first time. Fine, no problem. But when it didn't connect after 30 minutes, I emailed GloclaMe, hoping to get some help. They never responded. The site says that they will respond within 24 hours, but it has been 3 days and no response. Customer service seems to be nonexistent. Since the device didn't actually have a full charge, I thought maybe that was the problem. So while the device was looking for our wifi, I hooked it up to the computer to finish charging it. About an hour later, I checked on it. Well, it had finally found our wifi and had connected, but to my surprise and horror, 1 GB of data had already been used up!! I could not believe what I was seeing. Apparently, this device gobbles up data whether you are using it for texts and calls, or not. I haven't even made my trip to Europe yet, and my data is half gone. Imagine if I were in an emergency situation in France and needed to use my phone, then found that the wifi data was completely gone and I hadn't even had the chance to text or made a phone call yet. There is not a ""off"" button. You have to hold the power button for 3 seconds to turn it off or on, but there is no way of knowing if the device is truly off (or on). You might think it is off and all the time it is eating up your data on the sly. Adding to my disappointment, I found that the unit comes with a card that says: ""Get 10 euros top up credit for free!"" But when you open the card, you have to write a 5 star customer/feedback review in order to get the free credit. That probably explains why there are several 5 star reviews. Ethical? I don't think so. So there you have it. Thankfully, I was able to return the item to Amazon. So grateful to Amazon and their return policy.",55.0
127073,BLU LIFE ONE X2 - 4G LTE Unlocked Smartphone - 16GB+2GB RAM - Grey,,149.99,4,"I purchased this phone the first of November and have been using exclusively for 3 weeks now, and very pleased with it, I was using and LG G4 before I purchasing this one and find the day to day performance pretty much on par with the G4. they primary reasons I choose the X2 were for the RAM of 4 Gigs and on Board Storage of 64 Gigs. and I actually wanted something smaller that the 5.5 inch screen which is becoming the standard for todays smart phones. The home button/finger print scanner work amazingly well. I was surprise as well how good the display is, very vibrant with good clear color. Some people have complained about the weight of the phone, I have not noticed an issue, it feels quit premium in your hand not at all like a budget phone. The battery life has been great. I am a pretty heavy user and have be satisfied with the battery life and the quick charge seems to do it job. As for the Camera, Well that is the weak point on this phone, It ...well ..it just isn't very good. It does the job but far from something you will find on other devices in the same price range, I had a Zenfone 2, with 4 Gigs of RAM that I paid about 30$ more for and the camera was significantly better than this one, but it only had 16 Gigs of storage and no finger print scanner. ( with a budget device, sacrifices need to be made somewhere). That being said, for $200.00 you would be hard pressed to find a better phone for the money.",2.0

379207,Samsung Korea SAMSUNG GALAXY S4 MINI GT-i9195 LTE 8GB- FACTORY UNLOCKED International Version - Unlocked Cell Phones - Retail Packaging - White(NO WARRANTY),Samsung,379.0,1,"The device arrived the same day than other products despite the extra $$$ for the two day shipping. It was late if we consider that was expected after two labor days. It was a waste to have two shipping days...The device itself is great. I had the old vibrant S4G from t-mobile but just broke its screen. This G4Smini is just a little bit bigger but best replacement. I do not like the super sized S4. The model is the GT-I9195 from somewhere in europe (france?). It comes with a brochure from the mobile company Orange. After charged, I turned it on and asked me the preferred language, data for account logins and internet. Created some accounts as well and finally was up and running fine. The charger has a plug useful in some countries in europe and many other countries in latam etc. The seller included an adapter for the US connector. The box itself appeared unopened with its seal intact, but a more careful look showed that the seal was on top of a previously broken seal. Both seems to be official but who knows how hard can be to make a sticker with the words ""samsung"" on it... The device had plenty of plastics protecting all the sides and corners so it looks ""enough"" new to me.The cons:- horrible boot screen. No idea how to replace it without rooting the phone.- many not needed applications you cannot uninstall unless rooting the device (as most smartphones).- it uses microSIM cards... No idea why since it has plenty of space for the regular SIM cards. I had to buy a cutter to trim my old SIM.- the device comes with android 4.2.2. I was expecting something more recent. At least 4.3, or an update. But no....- its price feels way too high for a device with only 8GB of internal memory (already shared with OS and the several updates to its original apps).I recommend the product but knowing in advance its details.EDIT: Be aware that as with previous model, Samsung messed it up. Firmware 4.2.2 ""allows"" to move apps to SD to free internal memory space. But it is not true... all it does is to say it did it, but it only moves the apps to a sort of partition or folder ""./emulate/0"" on the same INTERNAL MEMORY!!!! Checked many forum and this issue is reported since S III, but is still not solved by Samsung.Some stated that firmware 4.3 may solve it but my Kies still says 4.2.2 is the latest firmware.This is a HUGE fault on this device. My previous S4G Vibrant, really moved the apps to the SD as most android devices. It is one of the plus over iPhones. But this one, more modern and very expensive device just fakes it. Do not get confused by Samsung Support FAQ stating this is only due to developpers of some apps not using SD compatibility, because no one app was in fact moved to the SD card. All went to the emulated area inside the internal memory despite stating the app was moved to SD. I even checked my SD card on linux to see all hidden forldes and NADA. No one app was moved there, not even a folder was created to do so. Google this issue and you will find many forums showing this problem.I do not like when manufacturers LIE and sellers do nothing to inform their customers about what the product really is. This bug is known since long time and the seller should know the products they sell. When I press move to SD, and it says it did it, I expect to find it on the SD card. Too much to ask?My internal memory is getting full by just having built-in apps auto-updated.I am overseas now. Otherwise I would ask for a full refund.No, I do not recommend this product until Samsung offers a firmware update that solves this issue.",18.0

It was my primary phone until the Lumia 920 came out in November. Since then, I keep my Focus around when I travel out of the country and in situations where I would not want my primary phone to get lost or damaged.My first Focus lasted over 18 months, surviving frequent drops, tosses, pockets with keys, heavy rain and other disasters. This is much better than any cell phone I had used up until that point. I finally managed to crack the screen dropping down some cement steps. I replaced it with an HTC Surround, which barely lasted 4 months under the same conditions. After the HTC phone died, I went and got a new unlocked Focus on Amazon.Though tough, the phone is a finger print magnet. It also feels really cheap and lightweight. For all their cool kit inside, Samsung never produced a phone that looks and feels as expensive as it is.The hardware on the phone was great in 2010, and still feels pretty good today. The AMOLED screen is bright and very vibrant but a little pixelated. The Sound is pretty good. The phone uses NAND memory, which is faster than many SD card based phones. There is an expandable SD card slot (the only Windows Phone 7 device to have one), and the removable battery is a huge plus when traveling.Tinkerers will like the Focus too. That SD card comes in handy, and the unlocked boot loader allows you to flash custom Windows Phone ROMs. You won't be getting Windows Phone 8, but you can flash to 7.8, however. Right now, there are only a few games and apps that require WP8 (Temple Run, Modern Combat 4 are two examples).At $100, this phone is less than half the cost of a budget Lumia 520. The phone is certainly cannot keep up with high end phones today, but it does not feel slow or obsolete like Android phones from 2010.",0.0

256849,"Motorola RAZR V3 Unlocked Phone with Camera, Video Player--International Version with No Warranty (Satin Pink)",Motorola,39.5,1,"The phone should come in with satin pink color for the cover. However, this phone has 4 different pink tones for different cover panels and the tone differences are so obvious. This made me feel that this is a phone which did not pass quality control from the original factory. The battery and charger are terrible. The original charger had 2 round legs for probably an Asian outlet and it came with a crooked adapter to convert it for the US outlet. In addition, the battery is constantly drained, if the receiving signal was not strong enough (compared to my Sony phone using the same SIM card). I have to recharge the unit every night even when the battery indicator is full --- since you never know when this thing will drained suddently. The cord for the ear phone is too short --- when I use it in my car, I have to put the phone on my lap. The ear phone quality is really bad and its operation is not as straight forward (handled by a single hand) as the Sony phone. Plus, the line is so easy to fall out of the phone to cut off the conversation. I no longer feel comfortable to use the ear phone while I am driving.

131146,BLU PURE XL Smartphone - 4G LTE GSM Unlocked - 64GB +3GB RAM - Gold,BLU,134.95,5,"One of the best phones on the market today. I previously owned the BLU Studio 5.0 II and was very pleased with it, but I felt it was time for an upgrade. I was debating going with another mid-range phone and also purchasing a tablet, but decided to go with the BLU PURE XL 'phablet' instead. It has a nice big screen but doesn't feel 'huge'. The resolution is amazing easily at par with the other flagship phones on the market. I am very impressed with the camera as well. I haven't taken too much time to tweak the settings but it takes crystal clear HD photos even in poorly lit indoor settings. One thing that surprised me as well was the preset APN settings, no need to try to search for them online or call customer support. It doesn't come with very many pre-installed apps to bog down the storage and memory. I am impressed with the strength of the antenna and the sound quality of phone calls. The speaker is very loud and sounds great too.The only 2 downsides to the phone might be the battery since it drains rather quickly when playing games. However, with the quick charge that is easily overlooked. The other downside is the lack of decent cases. The phone comes with a very thin cheap gel case, a cheap flip case, and cheap plastic screen protectors, none of which will do very much to protect the phone in case of a drop. I purchased a glass screen protector and a couple different cases. The glass screen protector looks and fits great, however, the cases I purchased were very underwhelming. Hopefully more and better cases will be available in the future. For now, I am using the clear gel case that came with the phone.Overall, after having the phone for just a couple days I can tell that this is an amazing phone and I would recommend it any day over a Samsung Galaxy or iPhone.",3.0

More info will follow.* Screen - 4"" screen was fine for what I needed, but the phone would have to be held at an angle in landscape for you to be able to see the entire screen. Hurts the eyes because the angle is off. Also makes the front facing camera almost unusable because of this.* CPU/GPU/RAM - Only 512MB RAM. Crashes when using any memory intensive app and when browsing graphic intensive webpages. GIF's do not display correctly.* WiFi - Would turn off by itself and require a restart to turn back off. Got worse over time and even stopped working for awhile. Had to do a hard reset on my phone and it still occasionally turns off by itself. SIM isn't recognized after some reboots, which adds to the headaches and requires more reboots.* Windows Phone OS - Not upgradeable to Windows Phone 10, depressing amount of apps available. Most, if not all, of Microsoft Apps run better on Android and iOS. Goes to show you the lack of developer support for Windows Phone. A lot of the good apps are developed by a 3rd party, which raises security concerns.* Messaging - Cannot view messages or send them. App crashes when trying to open a message.I purchased the phone on April 22, 2015 and I was able to live with all the other problems on the phone except for the messaging app problem, which started happening about a week ago.

259296,Nextbit Robin Factory Unlocked Phone - Midnight (1-Year U.S. Warranty),,249.99,2,"I really wanted to like this phone, I really did. I gave it a fair shot, but I ultimately sold it for the One Plus 3. I bought a blue one for my wife and a midnight color for myself. My wife is keeping hers so far. Here are my reasons for selling it:1. I just bought a 2016 Honda Accord with Android Auto. This phone never recognized with device. I changed everything: device (my wife's), flashed CyanogenMod, bought official type-C cable from Google play store, removed AA from battery optimization, and anything else I could remotely find online. Could never get it to even show any sign of connection. I finally resorted to Bluetooth, which leads me to...2. I rely heavily on bluetooth. I have 2 BT headphones, OBD2 adapters for 2 cars, 3 lost items trackers, smartwatches, external speakers, etc. The phone fails to connect ~40% of the time to my car, which is unacceptable, often dropping several minutes into the drive. It says it's connected, but audio comes from Robin speakers, not car. I can control the audio( FF, RW, Play/Pause) with car, but no audio through car. I have to disconnect and reconnect a random number of times to get it to keep a connection, anywhere from 2-10 times. It will most times send audio through for a few milliseconds before going back to the Robin speakers. While doing this process, the speakers on the Robin increase in volume immediately after the car BT disconnect. This has happened with headphones and speakers, but not as frequently. In addition to this clear annoyance, when I finally got it to hold a connection, it would sometimes bounce the audio b/t Left and Right speakers. I listen mostly to podcasts so I know it's not in any music.3. While trying to solve problem 1 listed above, I flashed every custom rom I could find in an attempt to get Android Auto to work. I noticed that few existed and all I could find were based on CyanogenMod. A bug existed at the time in every rom I tested: the phone would reboot immediately after hitting the call button.4. The fingerprint sensor failed way too often. It is my opinion that the failures are due mostly to the fact that the sensor is on the side of the phone vs the back or front of the device. It's a very skinny sensor and doesn't have the surface area of the front or back sensors. I ""taught"" the phone the same finger as 4 different fingers, systematically segmenting my finger into 4 rows for each of them. The One Plus 3 is much better at recognizing my fingers.5. The camera is still too slow, even after the update, and the picture quality is disappointing. It is slow to focus and I still miss many shots of my fast-moving small children.

At first, I had few problems with it. Camera did not work at first opening I needed to restart the program. But over a month or two this problem disappeared. Also, since start and til now, the message sound is quieter than normal but as second message comes at that time the sound becomes normal. I got used to it, and since normally the phone is actually loud, that lower tone for first message is quite nice because then I don't get scared of sudden loud sound. But it's a personal thing. Some people would say it's negative side. Few days ago I had a problem that it could not charge, but it might be because some crumb got into charging port. I never figured out why it happened, but same day this problem vanished. Now everything is fine.If you are android fan and want a smaller size phone, this is great. It is very responsive and fast. I use it with t-mobile and connection is wonderful. In addition, I can't remember a time that this phone would freeze, probably it never happened or just for very short time that I didn't even notice. Battery life, I can't really say it's wonderful having in mind I use my phone alot but it is for sure better than my old S3 .",0.0

Also, if I'm using my headset and the phone rings, the person calling won't be able to hear me unless I put that person on a speaker and then take them off the speaker. It is just inconvenient! The worst problem I'm having is that, calls go straight to voice mail and I'll only happen to know about it only if they leave a voice message. I called Samsung customer service and they said they won't be able to help me as the phone is an international version.

I ordered this Iphone 5c as a gift for my daughter for Christmas. When we got it the package that it came in was torn up. But since the phone ""SEEMED"" to be in great shape we kept it. My daughter received it on December 25th 2016 and on January 11th 2016 it fell out of her jacket pocket and the screen cracked. So we took it to the iPhone store in our city ( that has been there for many years) to get her screen replaced. Upon trying to remove the screen the man could not get the screen to pop out and I had just watched him do two iPhones before ours so it should have been an extremely easy task but it was not after about 3 to 4 minutes of messing with the screen he finally got one end to pop up then looked at me and asked "" Where in the world did you get this junk at"". When I asked what he meant he turned the phone around and showed me where the phone had already been refurbished and glue was used to put the screen back in with! Upon further inspection it was found that the iPhone 5c that we purchased had an iPhone 5s home button squeeze in there as we continue to look several of the screws that he removed did not even belong in that phone and were so long that they would not even screw all the way down. As we continued we also found that the stickers that go in the inside to let you know if it has been submerged into water were completely gone and non existent. Moving on we found that there was a metal plate just stopped off in the back of the phone that did not even go to an iPhone at all! The gentleman proceeded to open up another iPhone 5c identical to ours that had also been refurbished just so he could show what a horrible device we had bought! I will never buy from this company again and I will absolutely make sure that this information gets put up on every single blog that I run! Conducting business in this manner is unacceptable.",2.0

With the 4.5"" Moto G screen the 3 lower buttons (home, back, properties) is on the screen thus taking up space. With the BLU, the touch buttons are off the screen just below it, freeing up about another .25"".So in actuality the gain in screen size feels quite significant.Keyboard haptic feedback feels better.Phone is thinner and looks sleeker too.$30 cheaper with more accessories included: headphones, back case, screen protector, charger.Cons: Jellybean with no way to move apps to the SD card without rooting. No issues regarding screen resolution (it has 220 ppi), slightly less view angles and screen color temp is a bit cooler (bluish).Battery run time is slightly less. A whole day 15 hour light use drains the battery to about 40%.UPDATE 9/9:The battery usage is not as bad as I thought. We now end up around 50% with light usage all day which is on par with the Moto G LTE.One new downside we found was the video recording being poor in low light indoors. The Moto G was able to up the gain to get to the proper brightness while the Studio 5.0 LTE video was dark. I don't think this is due to Jellybean vs. KitKat but probably more of a hardware issue. Still a minor issue for me.",29.0

175340,CNPGD All-in-1 Watch Cell Phone & Smart Watch Sync to Android IOS Smart Phone (Gold),CNPGD,59.99,4,"Just got the watch and I have to say I like it! it is slightly thick but not terrible. The only gripe I have for now is the setup to my phone. WHAT A PAIN IN THE ASS.. it will connect but then it doesnt pair. After an hour of putzing with it, I found out the best thing to do is install the software using the QR Code on the watch (very cool by the way) then pair with the phone. Unpair with the phone. Turn off the BT on the watch and the phone. Turn the BT back on on both devices then connect. Viola! it starts working. The remote camera option is cool if not a little creepy. Seems like it could be used for less than legal practices.. I will use and report back further issues.. If Any..EDIT: 1 Week review..So I have had this watch for a week and would like to update you on my findings. After trying all the features i have come to the conclusion that this is still a fun device to have. The sleep monitor, Working but always says poor nights sleep. I am assuming it uses the motion sensor for this and how much you move during the night. As i am a restless sleeper, the watch is spot on.. Connection to the phone: This is where the watch lacks. Patience is a virtue on this. It will connect and stay connected as long as you are in range of your phone. 10 or more feet in a normal setting. I have noticed any location that has metal studs or office environment, The range is 2-3 feet at best. Not a big deal since they have crammed so much into this watch that the antenna for BT couldn't be very large. If it does drop, simply touch the messages button and touch connect and it will reconnect. It will bring up all the notifications it missed while disconnected and it does do almost ALL notifications including facebook. It only will bring up contacts and messages it you choose the bluetooth option for each on the watch. IT DOES NOT SAVE ANYTHING TO THE WATCH. It has to download contacts and messages each time you choose it. Depending on your phone it can take a few seconds. Cell phone option: I didn't get a chance to ry this but i did put a SIM card in and it picked up the network fine. For those of you who cant get the browser to work, It only works with the cell service. The watch does not pull the internet from your phone. The Pedometer: Works great but does have a delay. Not a big deal since you arent staring at the watch while you walk. It will catch up. Finally the software setup.. I have tried many sotwares in the hope the watch will stay connected. I have decided the watch is to blame for the distance (not a deal breaker). Do not use the QR code on the watch as the software it installs is an old version. Simply go to the play store and search ""Bluetooth Notification"" and install. The best part is you don't need to turn off any security. Also it is the same software that is on the watch but with updates through the store and a newer version. Open the app and turn it on. Then simply Pair the watch.. MAKE SURE YOU INSTALL THE SOFTWARE FIRST BEFORE PAIRING! In conclusion, this watch is very comfortable on the wrist and is a little think but not terrible. My only major gripe besides the connection issues is the fact that the USB port on the watch is NOT covered. I have found myself being very careful around water (washing hands, rain etc.) the port faces your hand and is very easy to get water in there. Don't be discouraged, the watch is $40 so the little things are tolerable. Have fun with it and don't expect a Moto 360. It is what it is and does a great job doing it!",15.0

When he sends it, it is this really weird clone, although I admit that the retina display is quite real, certain things are just not right, for example, the fact that the android version in it is 4.0.4 and is not upgradeable in this clone. Additionally, the phone came with no IMEI, yes NO IMEI!!! Therefore the phone could not be put in a network. I got a pretty clone of a paperweight. Again, STAY AWAY FROM THIS SELLER OR HIS PRODUCTS!",18.0

I have been using the Samsung Focus and loved it dearly (as much as you can for a phone, that is) so I was very disappointed when it broke just a couple of months before the new generation of phones came out. I bought the LG Quantum as a stop gap phone to try and and get me by until a pretty new Windows 8 phone came out.Pros:-Windows 7 (upgrade-able to 7.5) is really good-Build quality seems solidCons (for my particular phone):-Wouldn't charge 100%-Battery cover's prongs that kept it in place were broken so it never sat flush with the back-Speakers wouldn't work (so alarms and ringtones didn't work)-Keyboard was sluggish (Window's soft keyboard is WAY better)Windows is good, but I can't help but feel like I was shipped a used phone when nothing ever said it was going to be used. You'd be better off looking elsewhere and at higher quality Windows phones. Also, you probably won't use a slide out keyboard. It's way worse then the touch screen one. IMO.I returned mine and will figure out something else to get me by until Windows 8 Phones.",0.0

201559,Huawei Mate 2 - Factory Unlocked (Black),Huawei,229.99,5,"This is my first ""smart phone"". I had relied on a simple flip phone for the occasional emergency phone call till I got this ""phablet"" - a phone combined with a tablet computer. It's huge - even larger than the iPhone 6. But I love it in part because of its large size. One of its greatest features is its enormous battery, which I understand lasts twice as long as any other smart phone out there. The large screen also makes it easy to type on its virtual keyboard, to see small print on web pages, etc. Under the hood of this thing is a great deal of computing power! Take your pick - it's either a very large phone or a very small and powerful computer. I have rather large hands and I still use both hands to control it. That's fine with me because that's how I like to use it, but if you're looking to operate your phone with one hand it may be too large. It has as much power and greater speed than my laptop computer which is only a year or so old! Of course its memory capacity is smaller (16 Gb) than my laptop but it can easily be fleshed out with up to 32 Gb with a micro SD card (that you must purchase separately. I wanted this phone largely for international travel and though I haven't had it on the road overseas yet it looks very promising. The huge battery of course will be a plus. It has good Wi-Fi sensitivity and this will be good when Wi-Fi connections are lousy in airports, hotels, etc. Because it is ""unlocked"" I can purchase SIM cards in other countries and stay on line with data and/or phone virtually anywhere in the world. I cannot speak with authority about the Android operating system provided (I've only used Windows in the past) but I've been amazed at its capabilities and at the programs installed. My only complaint with this device is that the built in camera takes rather lack luster photos. It has plenty of megapixels but pictures tend to come out rather dull and colorless, especially in low light situations. This camera will do in a pinch but I'll still be taking an additional camera with my on my next trip to gather those beautiful vacation photos. Overall I'm extremely satisfied with this fabulous phablet and given that it's less than half the price of a comparable iPhone, I'd buy one again in a minute!",3.0

270305,Nokia Lumia 820 8GB Unlocked GSM 4G LTE Windows 8 Cell Phone - Black,Nokia,95.0,5,"First, a little background, for perspective: I'm an ex-iphone user, migrated from iphone to Android a few years ago, for the freedom and open-ness of the OS. I've really liked the Android OS and the phones I've bought along the way. A few months ago I bought a Lumia 521 with a new Metro PCS account. The Lumia 521 introduced me to Windows 8 Phone OS and I was amazed at how fluid, intuitive and FUN it is - so I decided to fork out for a premium Windows Phone ... which is what brought me to the Lumia 820.The NOKIA LUMIA 820 is SOLID. It's heavy in the hand and has a stable, durable feel to it. The display is vibrant and beautiful. Reviewers and ""experts"" out there on the web can say anything they want about resolution, rag on the pixel density, whatever - but this phone, in your hand is BEAUTIFUL. Colors pop, photos are crisp and videos look great!As was the case with my (brief) experience on the Lumia 521, this is quick, nimble, FAST. Every operation is there when called for, tasks present themselves immediately and close just as quickly. There's something about this Windows OS that must be much less resource-intensive, less hungry than other mobile OS's, because things just pop and fly all over the place.The Tiles ... live tiles, that represent what feels like a living, breathing OS Interface. You see the faces of your contacts and friends rotating in and out of the ""People"" tile ... Facebook posts of friends ""pop up"" in live time, as they are happening ... News updates circulate in a tile, the tile suddenly flips over to reveal another breaking headline ... the tile from your Songza app suddenly flips over to say ""It is Friday Night"" (or late Saturday morning, etc.) ... the Photos tile rotates through your albums, scrolling slowly and continuously ... nothing stands still, this tiled-interface is alive!More on Tiles ... you can size and re-size your tiles, according to taste; regular (square), large (rectangle that covers width of the screen) or small (one quarter size of regular). You can even Pin your favorite websites to the screen, each in a tile of it's own. I've got four favorite Playlists (from Nokia Music) pinned to my screen, each re-sized to small, and they form a little music ""block"", the size of a regular tile!The Lumia 820 has NFC capability and Wireless Charging - something I didn't think I'd ever need or use, but I did fork out for the charging plate and it's been a very nice bonus. I've already grown lazy, with the ability to simply place the phone on it's back for a charge ... no plugs, cables or hassles.CUSTOMIZATION! Unlike other phones in the Lumia lineup, this one has interchangeable back plates. Once in place, it looks like a solid piece of polycarbonate. You can make this a Cyan phone, a bright Red phone, Yellow, White or Black, simply by putting a different (removable) back plate on it. You can order these with or without NFC and Wireless Charging capability. This phone was black when I bought it, I've since changed it to Cyan (and have other colors on order).Is the 920 a better phone? How about the 928? Well, the specs are better on those phones, but for me, this is the sweet spot. It's smaller than the 920, but with the same screen size, and (again), with the joy of body / color customization. Processing speed? System RAM? What are those??? What do I care? When a phone is as fast, fluid, stable and zippy as this is, who cares? When you get a phone that performs as beautifully as this, you can forget about specs (and forget the ""expert"" opinions from the tech sites). None of it matters.Apps ... yes, you hear a lot of whining, complaining, hand-wringing criticism of the Windows app store and it's ""horrible dearth of apps"". If you believe what you read out there on the internet, you probably figure they've got about 10 or 20 apps in the store. I don't know WHO these people are, or WHAT they have on their own phones, but inasmuch as the Windows store has over a hundred thousand apps (126,000 as of last night) ... I feel that is enough for me (and for any reasonable person). Sure, you can bolster your app store to a million, 50 million, a billion, whatever - but when 50,000 of those apps are flashlights (as opposed to one flashlight), how is that improving your app experience?The 8GB of internal space ... once the OS requirements are subtracted, you've got about 5 or 6 gigs to yourself. Unlike it's bigger brethren in the Lumia family, this one comes with a Micro SD slot. I've got a 32GB card in mine, and have set the phone to load all photos, music and videos to the card (rather than to internal storage). That should hold me for awhile.The Camera ... with Carl Zeiss optics and Dual LED Flash, the 8.7 megapixel camera and quality of your photos will be excellent. I've also loaded an HDR app from the store and have experimented with it, garnering some very nice results. I've been taking photos for Instagram, Foodspotting, Facebook and Twitter so far, nothing that requires a critical eye or instrument. I have also set my phone to auto-upload all photos and videos to Skydrive, so I've got an instant backup of everything I've taken.I'm not going to spend any time hashing-out or ""reviewing"" technical details, you'll get plenty of that in other reviews (and websites). Suffice it to say, this is one of the best and THE most enjoyable phone I've ever owned.",90.0

Saw the wonderful reviews on amazon from purchasers and that gave me the confident to pull the trigger on a unknown brand in the west.Build quality surpasses that of LG G2, battery last a good two days with moderate use. Speaker, even though it is in the back, it is louder than my previous phones. Screen is very bright if you take off ""auto"" mode and set it to the highest. The reception is better than my previous phones. It doesn't get hot with use.No phone is perfect,My two dislikes are that 1) the notification LED is not bright enough. 2) not too much development support on this phone (nerdy). As you can see, these are very minor complaints.",8.0

254072,"Motorola Moto X (2nd generation) Unlocked Cellphone, 16GB, Black Soft Touch",Motorola,279.95,2,"I don't normally start with the bad but I will this time.The Cons:The lower speaker grill broke off within the first week even with a cruzerlite case. That is really disappointing.Battery life is inconsistent. Some days are 4+ hours of screen time and other days I struggle to get 2 hours being in the same place with the same signal.The camera is just bad. Poor focus, fuzzy pictures and even worse low light performance. To use the 13MP advertised you must use 4:3 aspect ratio. 16:9 is 9.7MP.The Pros:Beautiful screen. Bright and crisp AMOLED that is just a joy to use.Stock Android with a few light touches that are welcome. The notification light up on the screen is great and doesn't require turning the whole screen on to see what is happening.The moto assistant is overall helpful but sometimes just doesn't listen haha.Conclusion:I wouldn't recommend this phone. Maybe the new 2015 moto X can deliver a better device. There are a lot better options out there that perform much better especially with the camera and battery life.",2.0

It's been a long wait, but the newest flagship windows phone, the Lumia 950XL is here. It was worth the wait. Being as it is the single sim international version, it arrived in a ""Surface"" style box with a European power plug. The seller added a separate white adapter for us USA folks. After opening, I added my TMobile sim and 128gb sd card, turned it on and booya, it was working like a champ. I already had the Wireless display adapter so I was able to try Continuum and it worked great The screen is sharp and beautiful. Not all of the apps I had working on my 925 in Win 8 were avalaible for Win 10, I may add more to this review after I try out the camera.

212078,LG Electronics G3 Stylus D690 Dual SIM - Factory Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging (Black Titanium),LG,162.5,5,"I bought this LG G3 Stylus for my SO. I specifically chose the G3 Stylus option for him because he has manly hands/fingers (obviously). Sometimes he gets what I call the ""fatfingeritis"" where he goes to type something and ends up hitting a million keys at once. The stylus is perfect for someone like him. It is very sleek and tucks away into it's built-in hole, very well. He doesn't feel awkward holding it and feels it has a good circumference for him to handle.The phone itself is beautifully crafted. LG did a great job design-wise. The volume up and down buttons on the back allow for excellent ease of use. We like that they're separated by the power button as well. The buttons can be customized to operate other functions of the phone, such as the camera. If you do not wish to have that option, it is easily able to be switched off. I personally loved that when the camera is up, I can simply push the volume down button to take a selfie, for instance. There isn't that awkward messing around trying to get situate your thumb to push the button while attempting to get the right angle. Ladies, you know what I'm saying, right?! Not that my SO really cares about that option! HahaAnother thing my SO really liked was the slight curve of the phone. He felt really comfortable carrying the phone around without a case because he felt it fit perfectly with how his hand naturally holds the phone. With his job, however, we did buy him a case/holster combo. That review is posted as well. It is an amazing case!The specs on this phone are pretty awesome as well.The screen is 5.5 inches, which is pretty decent size in this day in age. My SO likes the larger screen because it makes for easier reading and less squinting. The rear camera is a nice 13MP. It is not the highest of phones out there but is decent for what he uses it for. This is a 3G capable phone and has an OS of 4.4.2 preinstalled out of the box. To determine the OS update, you can go through your service provider.",29.0

The operating system is butter. I'm coming from a note 5, LG v10, and a nexus 6p. All of them had bugs and between them and other phones from Android that I've had plus trying a iPhone 6 with keyboard issues I decided to try windows again. I first owned a 1520 that didn't pick up good on Tmobile but love it so I purchased a 640 xl to try and it picked up good but just wasn't as buttery smooth as the 1520 was.So I ordered the 950 xl after my problems with Android. I can say this thing is awesome. It's nice not having lag, stutters, or any app crashes. Granite there isn't some apps I've came accustomed to with Android but there's only a few. Like ups mobile, vudu, and Google music. But I can live without them. I can use the web for ups, and vudu on my tv. Thankfully rhapsody is free with Tmobile so that covers Google music.I highly recommend trying windows phone especially the 950 xl if you are in a similar situation like I was or just wanting to try a new OS out. I'll be a long time windows phone user if they keep this up.Edit: 3/29/16 after using the phone for a couple days it seems to loose signal and some apps have been crashing. I'm going to contact Amazon about a refund. It was a great phone but just isn't cutting it.Edit: 5/28/16,. Since 3/29 I've Purchased a iPhone 6s plus which was nice but just didn't seem right. Lack of some things like copy text, copy and paste, and file system hurt it bad. Copy text only worked on certain things. So I decided to try my luck with ordering directly from Microsoft to try the dual sim and see if that picked up better. Well nope not really. But after doing some research I've found that if you set your carrier to manual it locks on faster and stays stable. So I'm back to highly recommending this phone and windows platform. Hopefully this review will help others in the quest to find a phone there happy with. Glad to be back on windows again.",13.0

Also, Cricket said that it was an European phone instead of a USA phone and that was why it didn't contain all of the five frequency bands used by Cricket.

So far it has worked okay except when we were in the Dominican Republic on vacation last week. It would not allow messaging at all!

115760,"BLU Dash M - 5.0"" Smartphone - US GSM Unlocked - White",BLU,69.96,1,"I bought this phone as a replacement for my mom's phone. I prefer her having a smart phone so that I can load apps on her phone like Life360 to help keep track of her. She also likes her music, so I could easily load new songs remotely using Android. However, one of the criteria I have for using a phone is that it is possible to root, and so far, there are no known ways to root this Lollipop version. I should have done more research ahead of time. If I would have known this, I would have opted for a different phone.One of the reasons why the phone is inexpensive is that they've opted to leave out some of the sensors. The phone is with my mom now but based on GSM Arena, this phone only has proximity sensor and GPS. This potentially means others like gyroscope, orientation, pressure, and temperature sensors are missing or do not work properly. In addition, TeamViewer QuickSupport cannot remotely control this phone due to ""firmware"". I'm not aware that this is any general Lollipop problem, so it must be specific to this phone. Since I got this phone for my 83-year old mom, it's pretty much a deal breaker if I cannot help her with the phone remotely. When there is a problem with the phone or I need to load or configure some app to make the phone better for her, I cannot do it. I need to ask a neighbor or someone to do it for her as my mom would not be able to do it by herself.In addition, my mom was having problems reading some small print, so I thought I could use Google Drive to scan it, and then enlarge the print. Unfortunately, all the pics for close ups came out fuzzy. I think I read somewhere there is no autofocus for this camera? Whatever the reason, it's definitely disappointing no way to take macro shots. Update: In general, camera seems to be having major problems. It seems to have orientation all wrong, but the lack of macro focus is another deal breaker.",0.0

It has been a wonderful mobile for me on almost all aspects. From October 2014 up until June 2015 it was working without any flaws. Ever since that period the battery life has dropped significantly. It has dropped so much that I literally need my portable charger with me everywhere. I have never been a heavy user, nor am I the type who has a ton of games on his device. I have always been a moderate user. Very rarely have ever used it for consecutive hours. Apart from the battery life the mobile has slowed down a lot as well. The camera app takes a couple of seconds to turn on same goes for taking pictures. Taking pics has gone from hassle free to a chore. Still takes great pictures but just lags a lot that makes you want to avoid using it. Another issue is the Wi-Fi. When hitting the wifi ON it takes 15 seconds (measured by a chronometer) to turn on. That's right; 15 SECONDS. That's just not right. All these issues have been occurring about a year on and I am really disappointed. I was quite happy with this mobile but within the recent months I have even considered slamming this phone on the ground from the frustration that it gives me most of the time. Hence, I have never actually dropped it either so that just shows me how rubbish Android mobiles become after a year of moderate usage. Anyways if you want this mobile I do recommend you get it but don't expect it to be in good form after a year. Hope this review helped.",0.0

Samsung has come a long way from its plastic bodies flagship and the finish and quality of material used is at par with the best in offer today. This is my first Android but the reason for buy the larger version if the edge is the beautiful screen and its 4GB RAM coupled with quick charge facility. The screen is immersive and the camera is a delight, the ergonomics are good but the thin edge makes it difficult to hold with confidence but a genuine leather case(iCARER) made it easier for me. Remember, this phone is not for single handed use mostly so try it out in a brick and mortar store before deciding to buy this beast. Now, as far as the performance goes, I am disappointed with the efficiency of RAM usage by android, out of 4GB RAM 3GB is normally in use which makes me wonder how the regular s6 edge uses its RAM and what makes it increase in the s6 edge plus. There are great features on this phone that you keep exploring but to access all of that uses a lot of RAM which is inefficiency that I see in Android platform. When you compare that to iOS it only had 1GB RAM until 6S was released but the OS was solid and the battery usage and application performance was impressive. I wish people at Andriod can learn something on efficient usage of RAM from Apple. And the most important thing for people who are buying the international version, you do not have access to install and use Samsung Pay which is one of the main reason I bought this phone. Samsung Pay is only available in versions specific for US and Korean market which are sold through the carriers(priced higher). I hope Samsung releases Samsung Pay for International versions used in US/Korea pretty soon but until then that feature is turned off for this version of Samsung Flagship.",3.0

I appreciated the other features/specs but the quality camera I was used to left me so disappointed with this phone I ended up paying a thousand bucks in my currency for that I could not give the phone the 5 stars I would've given its predecessors.Samsung, I am so disappointed in this product (and in wasting my hard earned money on this phone) that I will try the iPhone next (and I prefer Windows to Apple).

I can see why people pay much more for iphones because they like the IOS, but for people using Android, I don't see any reason why anyone would pay double/triple the price for a Samsung or Pixel phone. There is no way Samsung can compete for the price/quality. Samsung would only survive because of the carriers' protection.Now that carriers all ditched 2-year contracts, I can see Honor or some other cheap (but great) phones take over the Android market.Pros:- Beautiful design: I think it's even prettier than the Iphone- Fast: it may not have the fast CPU, but it's very fast for everything I use. No hiccups anywhere.- EMUI: some people don't like the UI on top of the stock Android. I think that's personal preferences. I happen to like the UI, lots of small but very useful features, good battery management tool. No App drawer similar to IOS, but I don't really care, just create folders to organize Apps. No complaints about the EMUI so far.- Battery: good side is that it's much better than my Samsung phone (even after I got a new battery for my Samsung). Good standby battery management. I tested it one night, during my 8 hours of sleep, battery dropped 3% from full charge. With normal usage, you can get 5-6 hours of screen on time.Cons:-Battery: I talked about the good side, but I wish the battery is 20% bigger. It's already a very thin and light phone, adding 20% battery wouldn't make it bulky, but it will go a long way. I played Pokemon once awhile (~45 mins total time), it can drain battery quickly. With Pokemon playing time, I only get about 4 and 1/2 hours total screen on time. Not too bad, but may not last me a day. Again, wish the battery was bigger.Overall, an amazing phone. To be fair in terms of battery cons, there are not many phones with large batteries nowadays. Iphones have good standby time, but if you play Pokemon, they are still not enough. I hope the phone makers make the phones slightly thicker with a bigger battery!",1.0

162188,BLU Vivo Air LTE Factory Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - White,BLU,429.99,4,"I've had the Blue Vivo Air LTE for about 3 weeks now. I'm giving it 4 stars, but I'd call it closer to 3.5, but I'll give it the extra half a star because it's by the best mid range sub $250 I've ever had, that said it does fall short on a few things.Software: It comes with a few applications such as Blu Help, Yahoo weather, and Opera which you cannot get rid of, I don't mind it too much, they can be disabled, I've had many carrier name brand phones that all had a lot of bloatware. You can get rid of the keyboard it comes pre-loaded with and get the Google keyboard quite easily, its one of the first things I did, Other than that it relatively stock Android. After playing with Opera I actually ended up liking a lot more than Chrome, the way it does tabs is far superior. The task manager has a clear all button that stock android doesn't have, its much easier that swiping every card to the side manually to kill them. I am really happy to see flashlight is built into the pull down settings.Build quality: This device feels very premium, if you didn't know better you would guess it cost 2-3 times as much as it does. Without a case it does feel quite slippery in the hand, it does attract fingerprints easily. The metal band around the phone looks very sexy. Button placement for the power and volume switches is well laid out, no awkwardness like I've had on other phones, buttons feels quality, not mushy. This is the thinnest phone I have ever seen, it makes everything else look chunky by comparison. It feels very solid for how thin it is. The screen looks excellent, very vibrant colors and deep blacks, that's usually the case with any AMOLED screen, also it gets pretty bright, I keep the brightness down to about 20% if I'm not in the sun.Hard case that comes with it: The case it comes with is garbage, throw it away and get an Armorflex case. The hard plastic texture on the inside of the case will scratch up your phone, the only scratches on my phone are a direct result of the included case.Audio quality: The phone falls very short here, the speaker on the back is loud enough, but it sounds a bit distorted and its rear facing. Having had an HTC M7, M8 and a Nexus 6 which all had impressive speakers, the speaker on the Vivo Air LTE is just laughable. When taking a call the ear speaker does not get loud enough, if there is any noise around what so ever you won't be able to here the caller. The audio from the headphone jack sounds alright, but doesn't put out enough juice for some cans. I have not used the headphones that came with it.GPS: This is probably is biggest downfall, I am very dependent on a GPS for work, the GPS keeps dropping signal and lagging. I'm not sure if its the hardware, or if Google Maps is the problem, either way it isn't dependable.Cameras: I am not a camera snob, read other reviews for this info, picture quality seems adequate enough for my uses, the camera app is far better than the stock one from Google and has many options.Battery life: I get just over 2 days out of a charge, that said I am not a heavy phone user, I use it mainly for business (calling, texting, GPS, mobile banking) I don't use it for multimedia often, don't use it for social networking, no gaming, I don't have a lot of screen on time. A typical user will probably get a day to day and half out of it. The stock charger is a 1 amp, I would recommend getting a 2 amp charger, charges in about an hour and half.Performance: I am not a heavy multi-tasker, for my use case I have never felt like its sluggish in anyway except when killing all your apps, there is a couple second pause after that, but that's the only time it ever feels slow. Wifi range, and cell reception is about the same as every other phone I've had on T-Mobile. There is no NFC, but I have never used it on any phone I've ever had, so that isn't a big deal for me. Storage is definitely lacking. After installing a couple apps I have 8.4GB of storage left without any pictures, music, etc on my device. It does support OTG which does come in handy at times. I doesn't support Qualcom quick charge or wireless charging. I kind of wish it had dual sims and an SD card slot like just about every other Blu phone.How it compares to other phones I've had: I've owned phones anywhere from $30 up to flagships such as the HTC M8, Nexus 6, etc. I don't feel like I am making any really big compromises compared to flagship devices besides audio quality (and the GPS). Compared to every phone I've had under $250, this takes the cake, easily the best phone I have ever owned in this price point. Most sub $250 phones feel very plasticy, cheap, loaded with bloatware or make compromises in one way or another.At the end of the day I would recommend this to anyone that wants a slice of premium for a not so premium price. If there is a second generation, please give us front face speakers, a better GPS and a better included case.",4.0

Be careful if you deal with customer service and expect a new phone, they slip the term ""like new""in on you.

220961,"LG G3 D855 Factory Unlocked Cellphone, International Version, 16GB, Black",LG,195.99,5,"I did so much research before purchasing this phone, I could have advised people on how to use their own lol. This is a clear triumph for LG. Aside from some slight overheating and the screen occasionally refusing to go full bright in sunlight due to the processor temperature, this is a dream come true. I haven't used a data plan on it as yet, but I believe that I will have no issues. I previously owned a BLU STUDIO 5.0 C HD and it was child's play compared to this MONSTER. The LG skin hasn't gotten in the way yet, and if it does, i'll just install Cyanogenmod 12 for a pure Lollipop experience.Pros:*The screen has to be seen to be believed*Effortless rear Camera (download Snapseed from Play Store to really unleash your creativity, but its still amazing without)*Selfie camera is bright and surprisingly sharp!*Replaceable battery and a micro sd slot*Fits in my big hands PERFECTLY* SUPAFAST!*LED notification comes with over 8 colours (though they don't list white, I tested it and its available!)*The keyboard is VERY impressive for a stock experience*The buttons at the back of the phone are easy to use and adapt to, in a matter of days in fact.*The specs on this beast make it future proof. It will still be a very impressive phone within the next 4-5 years at least.Cons:-Settings look better on stock Lollipop-I wish it came with more options for moving apps from internal to external storage-Wish I could uninstall some useless apps-Processor overheating (occasionally)- Screen usable in bright sunlight, but may frustrate some if it can't go 100% due to the processor overheating,Tips:If you want to make this great phone even better, purchase a ballistic glass screen protector and a Supacase protective case. your screen will be un-scratchable and the device will also be able to take a beating without any damage being done.Ensure you keep the brightness setting to Auto. The battery is great, but it will save you more. There's also a setting that lets you choose to turn the screen of if the phone detects that you're not looking at it.Purchase a 64GB micro sd card if you really want to go the distance! They're under $30 now.This phone is sleek, powerful and beautiful.I got it brand new as promised and it was shipped within the time frame promised",7.0

Blu is the kind phone over there you never loose connection no matter how far you go. He just lost his olf blu and was very upset about it and I decided to get one from here, this same model is around a thousand reais in Brazil (lot money for them) so for $124, sold!I was impressed with the screen size and how nice the phone looks but got yo admit I got very upset checking the phone. I wasn't expecting a perfect phone but I definitely was expecting more! The front camera got this flash what helps a lot while taking pictures and if you freeze you kind can get a decent one. The front camera is awful, the focus takes forever and you have to wait about 2 seconds before you ""click"" the picture otherwise you will mess the image up! The video Oooh boy! Is decent if you stay and dont move around, if you do move no matter how slow, it will loose completly its focus, so trying to recording something in movement FORGET ABoUT IT. After also recording it, even thought the environment was quiet (I was inside the bedroom) there are too much noise in all videos I made, like it was winding '. And last of all, the volume! OMG it is really bad, no matter how high a video are the audio SUCKS!! I downloaded a volume boosting app called mobileuncle tools and still nothin =/ ! With headphones is a little bit better but not perfect, there a little noises! I know the phone was only a $124 but I've had other phones for about same price from Lg and Samsung and they were just great! I really wanted it to be good! At least I saved my dad R$ 1000. Definitely not worth it!Oohh the online videos images are alright though, and the battery really seems to be good, is been on low all night long since yesterday afternoon and still the same!

Battery life is great, much better than my iPhone 5s. The Android capabilities are great for someone that is using iOS for the past 3 years.The main setback of this phone is the camera. After getting used to the iPhone camera, this is really going backwards.

2324,"ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",Alcatel,129.0,5,"Honestly, I love this phone. I bought mine from Amazon Warehouse. Although it was used. It preforms well but my package didn't come with the jbl headphone, just apple headphones. As for most users, battery is a main concern. My idol 3 gets about four to five hours of screen one time. I would like to state I am a heavy battery user. Bluetooth enabled most of time for my moto 360 and Bluetooth devices. Data also enabled for couple hours. For my opinion, this is an average phone, battery wise. Buy a fast charger for this phone as it only comes with a standard alcatel charger. The NFC and the Gyroscope sensor work very well for VR streaming. On board speakers are greatly better than most phones due to the dual front facing features. The camera is just good. Nothing to write home about. I highly advise y'all to buy the ""A better camera unlocked"" app. There is also a free version if y'all are into that. The app will make the camera in par with the iPhone cameras. If y'all are wondering about the double tap to wake feature. I'd like to say it works but only with the one touch launcher. It might just be a software issue with the marshmallow upfate. Hope alcatel fixes it soon. As of now. I use nova launcher with the knock lock app and the gravity lock app. Works well in unison.Overall. Great phone for the $200 mark. I did get mine used and for cheaper the price. Nothing bad. Hope this review helped your decision to consider this phone. Thanks bye bye",3.0

For a 13 MP camera, the colors in the pics were washed out and many of them were shaky, I suppose that's where the lack of image stabilization comes into play, especially with indoor photos. And the 8MP front facing camera when used indoors had so much noise I was simply shocked at the result. Black or shadowy areas were full of noise and even lighted spaces were fuzzy. My Samsung's 2.1 MP front camera outperformed the Idol 3 which was very surprising.In outside lighting the camera was merely decent, but some backgrounds would be washed out. Playing with the exposure helped some, but simply not enough. I also read that perhaps you could download a different camera app that would help with the faded issue, but that really shouldn't be necessary for a 13 MP camera. Also many tech reviews about the camera were positive, so either I had a faulty device or my standards are just way too high.I was really disappointed since the phone itself was very nice and had some nice features that I didn't really get to explore. Anyhow, I sent it back. I ended up biting the bullet and laying down the cash for the LG G5.",0.0

This time, I thought Amazon would be a more trustworthy source it was quite disappointing. I got a phone in it's own box but firs thing that stroke me, a 1 year warranty card from Consumer Certified Repairs... this phone is supposed to be new!!! I got a refurbished phone!! Next disappointment, a cheap battery, not the original Blackberry battery. It holds a charge for about 8 hours. I had to but another one, which was another nightmare because Amazon sells many as ""the same that comes with Blackberry phones"" and the picture is of an original battery at $15. Now I don't trust Amazon so I did not purchase any of these but had to shell out another $50 for a Seidio. Another thing, I believe this phone should've included a protective ""leather"" case which comes with every BB and I did not get it. Now my last and greatest grievance and it goes in another paragraph...I was not able to get this phone on a Blackberry plan!! At the phone company they told me that the series this phone belongs to is not in the Blackberry database so it cannot be set up in the BB plan! I did not get any specifics, not sure what that means and not even sure if it is banned for any reason or what. Anyways, this is the last time I buy a cell phone from Amazon.

254180,"Motorola Moto X (2nd generation) Unlocked Cellphone, 16GB, Black Soft Touch",Motorola,279.95,1,"Don't buy this phone! I bought a Motorola Moto X 2nd generation phone for my college age son to take on a trip to South America. He's pretty careful with phones and is rather tech savvy.Throughout his trip, he contacted me regarding a number of issues he had: the phone kept overheating, poor battery life, poor connectivity (despite the fact that he had an international plan with data). The final nail in the coffin was about three weeks into his trip this phone crashed and upon rebooting the display was black and the phone ran very hot. Imagine trying to help someone troubleshoot something from 6000+ miles away and a 5 hour time difference. Try searching on google for ""Motorola moto x black screen"", there are hundreds of reports of this issue, with very few positive outcomes. The potentially tragic part of this was that my son took 700+ pictures before it failed. We finally gave up and upon his return we spent almost an entire day trying to troubleshoot this issue. Nothing we did changed this situation, all attempts to revive this phone failed. On a positive note, it did manage to connect to my home wifi network and all (we hope) his images did get uploaded to Google via the Photos app we downloaded prior to his departure. I tried everything on the Motorola troubleshooting web page and finally called their technical support line. I spent over an hour on the phone with people who obviously knew nothing about their product. Turns out this is a known issue, for which there is no resolution other than wiping the phone. They offered to repair/replace the phone. The insulting part was that they wanted to charge me a $25 fee for ""expedited replacement"", I opted for the standard free service. Here it is almost two weeks and still no word on when a replacement unit will be sent. I will never purchase another Motorola product as long as I live. Mind you, this is coming from someone who has owned numerous Motorola phones, including my current Motorola Droid Turbo. From now on I will take the advice of my friends and buy more reliable phones such as a Samsung Galaxy or a Google Nexus. Don't waste your money or your time on this device.",2.0

Oh well, that's what tech does, I guess. Anyway, this is a terrific phone for the money. I looked at an IPhone, but their prices for an unlocked phone are beyond ridiculous. So, for about a fifth of the price, I got this phone. It's great. It doesn't look cheap, and it performs VERY well indeed. And it seems to be well built. I was a little hesitant buying a Motorola product, but as soon as I saw they were a Google company, I knew it would be alright. And it is. Beautiful display, quick response, and, to me, very easy to use. Don't hesitate if you're considering buying one of these babies - you'll be glad you did!",1.0

So long story short, broke my Nexus 6 and didn’t want to spend a lot of money on a new phone. I tried out a Sony Ultra C5, I didn’t like the screen at all, otherwise nice phone, so I sold it. Then I tried an LG G3 and it was a great phone but the GPS and camera were terrible. Finally I saw this phone on sale for $99 and figured why not?Well it was a great decision. This phone has been updated to Android 6.01 and everything runs well on it for the most part. This is not a fast phone, but it is a fast enough phone. I am able to browser this Internet, play emulators, and watch movies with ease. Again, it isn’t perfect but for $100, or around that price, it is an amazing value!Highlights:- Fast enough CPU/GPU (with occasional freezes/stuttering, but doesn't get too hot)- Expandable storage- Wonderful front facing speakers that can fill a small room with sound- Decent 1080p IPS LCD screen- Near stock android skin- Excellent all day (with moderate usage) battery life- Fantastic 8mp rear facing camera- Great audio quality with headphones- Surprisingly good call quality- Built in music app is fun and useful- NO BLOATWARELowlights:- Front facing camera is only average with poor low light performance- Multi Media messages like group texts, email texts, and photo texts don’t work on stock messaging app- CPU/GPU does stutter occasionally- Phone is a bit ungainly and slippery in hand for one-hand usagePro-tipsTo fix the MMS bug I mentioned about texts under lowlights, use a third party program off the Google Play Store such as Textra. Additionally, I disabled the “enhanced 4G LTE” setting on the phone and that seemed to help.As for the display, it is great for the price, but it tends to run a little on the “cooler” side in terms of color. You can adjust your color hue under settings. I personally bumped it up one on the color warmth and it looks significantly better. Furthermore, the phone display is extremely bright so things may look a little washed out. To fix this, find an area that is well lit (one that represents where you spend most of your day), and then slide the brightness all the way down, then slowly increase it until you find the colors have the right look about them. Personally, I have mine set to about 35-40% brightness. You can always flip the brightness to “auto” when you go into an extremely bright or dark area.",

Another consumer (I think) pointed out that it uses a different network than Verizon and that I should have done my research. Well, maybe I should have. But I don't know, I'm a consumer, and even though I agree that consumers should indeed do their homework, the majority will read ""Super Cool Quad Band Watch"". And since there is no disclaimer in the specifications, most would probably buy it. I mean I'm not an expert, but how many people really know what GSM or CMDA means? If the Verizon guy couldn't figure it out......Anyway, I bought this product, took it to my cell phone carrier (Verizon) and they could not get it to work. Because I am not willing or able to search all of the cell phone carriers to find out which one can get it to work, and because of the fact that it is way more bulkier than I thought, I returned it.You know what, in all fairness, I'll upgrade my rating because I can't speak on how it works. But I got a white one and the watch band is a noticeable different shade of white compared to the watch. If you are getting it for your kid like I did, just know that it is bulky and looks like someone grabbed a nokia and trimmed off the key pad and slapped it onto a wristband. JUST MY OPINION.

I had read about the ""Jitterbug"" a few years back and when I decided I would try to live my retired days with cell service only the ""Jitterbug"" was my choice. My Verizon phone is getting old but gets fairly good service on the island and I thought I read somewhere that ""Jitterbug"" operated over the Verizon network. But my little red phone's capability was poor giving me dropped/lost service calls. I love the phone and would like to know how I could use the ""Jitterbug"" as a verizon serviced phone or how to return a new ""Jitterbug"" phone in ""unopened condition"" as the label states when I have had to use it to find out it doesn't work for me here, now.

After learning it's lesson with the heavy-handed (and painfully slow) Timescape, Sony's Android skin is smooth and silky, never more so than on the Xperia Z. I am honestly surprised how much I fell for this phone, as am huge tech junkie and go through 'em quick either through contract or importing 'em outright. But the Z is solid, the weight is great, and is sexy as all get-out. The update Walkman app is a fine and fluid hub for all your music, and with the SD card slot, you can really pack 'em in. Camera is fantastic, tho can't touch Nokia's Lumia 1020 (who can?). Forget the nitpicking you've heard over the viewing angles of the screen-with clarity and color like this, you're gonna spend all your time staring at it head on. Waterproofing is lagniappe but very cool. While Samsung is busy copying and churning out the same old stuff and cheap design, Sony is going through the stratosphere on sleekness, speed and style. My sim card has been stuck in this phone ever since I got it, and if you knew me, you'd know what a big deal that is. Can't wait to pair it with the Smartwatch 2, on it's way.

I tried wiping the phone but it still happens. The security features are nice, but definitely not perfect.However that's NOTHING compared to the hardware. It won't lay flat on a table anymore because it's warped (I've only had it for 6 months). The only place I've kept it is my pocket. I can actually bend it back to its original shape - it doesn't take a lot of force. Flimsy material honestly. The screen is badly damaged from very light wear and tear. Due to the warping and screen damage, half the time it thinks I'm tapping the screen when I'm not. This has led to me randomly dialing people, randomly texting people garbage, hundreds of photos of the inside of my pocket, etc. It's like the phone is posessed when this is happening. When I get incoming calls half the time the screen is unwilling to acknowledge my taps - and the call goes unanswered. When I'm texting someone the keyboard will start tapping itself and ruin whatever message I was composing - and interrupt my train of thought. Sometimes I can't unlock the screen because the screen doesn't want to acknowledge my swiping. The position of the power button is unfortunate - it's very easy to accidentally reboot my phone while it's in my pocket.This thing is junk.

I was somewhat concern with the recent reviews where the early production phones suffer from sudden death. Mine was manufactured in Jan 2016 and finger and toes crossed that it is not affected. So far this phone is flawless in its operation, it updated out of the box to Marshmallow and there are no performance bugs to report or visual defects in manufacture. The phone also came with earbuds...only downside of the packaging is the default LG Charger is not Qucik Charge 2.0 certified even though the phone supports this. The charger does rapidly charge the phone from 10 % to full in just over an hour though so no loss there. If there is a complaint it is that the battery it ships with is 2900mAH and not 3000 mAh. Battery life though is decent but I would have preferred the higher capacity battery given the cost to purchase genuine LG OEM 3000mAh battery.",

377694,"Samsung i5500 Corby Galaxy 5 Android Smartphone with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, Touch Screen - No Warranty - Black",Samsung,79.94,4,"Long time Linux user, first time Android user's perspective: I picked up one of these and bought my wife a Google Nexus S in January of 2011. The screen is roughly half the size on this one & there is a very noticeable difference while trying to run games or failing to run 480p+ video content, but it works just fine for me. Bought it as a Sansa Clip+ replacement, and I'm extremely happy with it. No comments on voice quality, 3G/EDGE or GSM connection quality - I have yet to test the device with a SIM card, and am using it solely as a personal media player. (I.e. I got tired of waiting for a market enabled iPod Touch competitor)What it can do:* Angry Birds - Some lagginess when a media player is cranking MP3s out in the background, but no major issues. Occasionally hangs up & has to be killed in lengthy sessions.* Voice search - Requires installing the speech-to-text synthesizer, but impressive accuracy & works fine on this limited hardware.* Froyo - The Latin America firmware seems to work. Not accessible through Samsung's provided Keis software, but available from third parties.* Speaker - Respectable music playback & spoken word playback for its price range* Camera - Take decent stills for its price range.* Unplug/Plug-in pause/resume - Addictive feature, but likely common to many Android devices.* Decent battery life - I've been charging it every two days or so, with regular use of the Wi-Fi in the evening and 3-4 hours of daily use as a media player with the screen turned off. Otherwise always kept in standby. (Again, this is SIM-free, no GSM radio usage.)* Wi-Fi - WPA2 Wi-Fi support. Tethering seems to be an option in the Froyo firmware. Didn't check the stock.* MicroSDHC - No issues & good solid seating for my 16gb MicroSDHC card. Located behind the snap-on/snap-off battery cover, but the battery does not have to be removed to get to it. A 1 or 2GB card was included with the phone.* Video - Converting to a lower bitrate seems to be necessary for most of my videos, but no complaints. Small enough screen that there's nothing to be gained from sticking with higher resolutions.What it does poorly:* Wi-Fi disconnections - With both with stock firmware and the official Froyo build, my experience has shown the device to be prone to dropping the Wi-Fi connection when in use by certain apps, or more commonly when leaving.* Volume levels - I frequently find myself wishing there was some sort of equalizer or system-level volume boosting functions I could use to compensate for low volume levels in certain audio tracks. Fine for normal music, but often inadequate with soft-spoken announcers in audio books and podcasts with heavy traffic noise. I will definitely have to buy amplified headphones prior to taking flying with this device.* VPN connections - The Froyo VPN tool looks nice enough, but is extremely finnicky.* FM Radio - Depends on a wired set of headphones for the FM antenna. A common problem, but slightly annoying.* Apps-to-SD - This Froyo feature seems to be somewhat overrated. Frequent problems with apps that say they support the move, but then disappear from the application menu afterwards. Still, even after giving up, with some 30 apps installed, I have 30.8Mb of the 170Mb of internal flash available. Apparently this just isn't that big a deal.What it won't do:* Multitouch - Unfortunate, but made up for in large part by the numerous buttons & the D-pad.* Flash (bulb) - It doesn't have one, not that many do in this price range.* Flash (Adobe) - The processor seems to be incompatible with the current builds of Adobe Flash. Haven't personally tested it, but it's not all that likely to work. There may be other workarounds.Notes for battery hoardin' folks:* Uses MicroUSB chargers - Tested with BlackBerry charger & a solar charger without problems.* 3.7v, 4.44wh, 1200mAh li-ion battery. M/N: AB474350BUA few quick 5500-tested App recommendations: MortPlayer Audiobooks/Music, BeyondPod, Pulse, Aldiko, Comixology, Droid Comic Viewer, Angry Birds, and File Expert (That last gives integrated FTP & HTTP file management - I basically never use a USB connection for data transfers.)Market glitches from use overseas, in Chile (not yet in the paid-app country white-list):* I don't know whether this is because of the firmware or my physical location, but it was impossible to obtain numerous free apps and ANY paid apps out of the box or after updating to Froyo. Using the new web-based app market, I can see paid apps, but none will allow me to install and many apps that ARE available through the normal market refuse to install due to ""carrier restrictions"" on this unlocked, SIM-free phone.* Free apps I was unable to install included: Amazon's Kindle & MP3 stores, Google Books, the voice-to-text synthesizer, and Google Listen. Free apps loaded on the phone that I was unable to update included Gmail, YouTube, and Google Search.* The issues above can be wholly resolved using Market Enabler, but that requires rooting the phone. I would be very interested to hear if a VPN to the US or simply being present in the US or another country with paid-app access has these same issues.[Aug 2011] A couple quick updates, six months in:* Wifi disconnections - This proved to be largely an issue of signal strength. This device has a perfectly usable wireless range, but it's still not quite as good as some other devices in my appartment. A second router and setting the wifi sleep mode to ""never"" or ""never when plugged in"" was enough to resolve this issue.[...]* GSM use - Took the device home to the US on vacation and picked up a prepaid TMo SIM. Worked just fine, but only EDGE (at least using the i5500L Froyo ROM). That was enough to eliminate the need for the Market Enabler. Allows purchase of paid apps even after my return to Chile.* Battery life update - Massive change in battery life when I was stateside. With heavy use of the browser & Google Maps and occasional use as a phone, I found myself needing to change batteries at mid day every day while on vacation. Fine for tooling about town, although it still drained much quicker than w/o a SIM, but constant Maps use while playing the tourist in NYC absolutely killed the battery life.",79.0

For the price point this watch feels and looks pretty high end. The screen is super responsive and the UI is a bit tricky, but after 10-15 minutes I was all good with it. Charge time was decent, I went from 50% to full in under an hour. Battery life, under normal use, notifications, bluetooth connection, occasional time checking and steps, was ok, full day and it was down to about 45%. So, expect close to 2 days of usage from this watch.The bad: This is Android compatible, not Android Wear. So, there is no way to get Google Apps on this watch. You're stuck with whatever apps already come with the watch. Earpiece is the USB headphones, so you can't use any standard 3.5mm headset with the watch (I have Beats and it will not work with it). Even though the screen is responsive the apps are not really good and not friendly to use.This watch is an ok experiment, but if you're looking for Android Wear device this is not it",6.0

(Model#: E550 WHITE)",Posh Mobile,97.99,5,"While I've only had this a few days, so far it's far better than I expected. A few notes about some issues users report.1. The phone as of 2016-05-18 did NOT work on metropcs, so save your time, at least not in my area. T-Mobile and ATT are fine. I believe some of the entries on amazon say it works on metropcs, that's incorrect. It will work on any network that accepts unlocked GSM phones.2. The usb charger is not hard to work around, all you have to do is take a standard length microusb plug, take a hardware store razor blade, and slice away at an angle from the plastic connector down to the metal part, it's really not difficult, and there's no need to worry about having the slightly longer included cable, I just cut away at about a 45 degree angle and a standard cable fit fine. The case is at a slight angle where the connector meets the body, so that side can be cut away slightly more than the other. Without this cable mod, the connection was erratic using a standard usb cable, with it, it's fine.3. Standby battery life is quite good, but when you use it for anything, the battery drains fast, but that's why it only weighs 52 grams, you can't expect a tiny battery to have a long life, that's not realistic.This little phone is amazing, they've actually managed to cram a full android smart phone onto the device. Typing on it is delicate since the key icons are so tiny, but you actually get the hang of it unless you have thicker fingers.In terms of size, this phone is literally about the same size as just the top lid part of an old flip phone I have.I can't think of a better phone for things like backpacking where you need to have a phone for rides etc, and for me, I prefer this small size, I almost never carry my full sized smart phone because I just don't like that size.I won't know for a year how durable this thing actually is, but honestly, at the price, I don't even care if it fails, you can buy 12 of these for every galaxy or iphone you buy, and they aren't nearly as adorable.",3.0

The browser has no forward button, start page or home button, very inconvenient4. MOST OF ALL, FREE UP MUCH OF THE FILE SYSTEM RESTRICTIONS, if you download something there is no way to find them or get them off the phone, (leave that for evil and crazy iPhone), a file manager preferably with network/workgroup capabilities, it is windows after all.5. Being able to create folders would be nice for organization, convenience and speed6. The NAVIGATION needs a few things, firstly to be a bit more accurate, often it shows a destination as in the middle of the road or in a vacant lot next door, but also a quicker was to search favorites especially when looking for a destination, more and quicker ways to select DRIVE TO when viewing a saved location and to tell us if we will arrive at our destination on the LEFT or on the RIGHT or STRAIGHT AHEAD, how else will we know which lane to be in, do you know how inconvenient that can be on a 4 lane highway?7. A built in way to check minutes and messages used based on free numbers, out of package numbers, reduced rate times and overseas calls8. NO EXTERNAL MEMORY, WHAT? HD video recording (10Gb per hour) and 41mp pics? My music collection alone is 16gb.9. BEING ABLE TO SYNCHRONIZE with a PC desktop software and OUTLOOK via USB, wifi OR/AND bluetooth.10. A quick console for WIFI, BT, DATA, PROFILES, RESTART, BATTERY SAVER, FLASHLIGHT etc.11. A ""breathing light"" option for the sleep state to we know when an alert is waiting.12. A non wifi network dependent way to show play video and images to nearby devices, perhaps Miracast along with the DNLA, and a way to show the phone’s screen as well.",9.0

This phone does have some issues. And maybe I'm being a bit harsh because the purpose for this phone is to be a back up to my beloved Samsung Galaxy Note 3, which I now appreciate much more for the finely polished piece of sweetness it really is. Back to this phone. So, I'll start with the shortcomings. The touchscreen is a bit sensitive. For scrolling gestures, you need to press a bit firmly before swiping so not to select something to open up, like a picture or comment tab in Facebook. Takes a bit to get used to but no bid deal. The colors are a bit washed out compared to other screens I've seen. Once huge issue has to do with Pandora Radio (app) where music has a constant skip like ever minute or so, whether its on T-Mobile's network or WIFI with full bars. I believe the issue between the app and the phone. Doesn't do it with other music apps. Now the PRO's. For a big phone, it fits much better in my pocket than the Note does. The phone doesn't lag much if at all. The screen is bright and video rendering is better than acceptable. PLEASE install a more stable launcher like Google Now or Nova. You will love the phone much more. Very stock Android - LOVE IT. Camera takes a bit to get use to, but when you figure out how to focus, it takes GREAT SHOTS! The dual LED flash is really a nice feature. Battery lasts me almost 2 days with moderate use. Charges fast. Call quality sounds good on the head set / ear piece. Speaker is a bit tinny and not as loud as it should be. So you may ask ""Why 5 stars dude?"". Because this phone does all the things my Note 3 does, ALMOST, as well and anyone can by it UNLOCKED for $129.00. My Note 3 was $600.00 on T-Mobile. But I got my Life 8 XL for $79.99 on pre-order!!!!!!!! I honestly feel bad critiquing this phone. The fact that BLU can make this phone available for $129.00 is nothing short of a miracle to me. The finish of the phone is really nice and I will by more of their phones. I got my eye on the BLU Studio Energy because of the 5000MA battery. 4 - 5 days on a single charge is AMAZEBALLS. So in closing, I love this phone and really feel I got an amazing value. Please send me your questions. I'm happy to help. Peace.",1.0

Bought this for my best friend for Christmas since she has a job that won't allow her to have her phone at her desk but she is allowed things like smart watches, we wanted to be able to get ahold of her quickly if there was an emergancy at home. She opened it, played with it for about 20 minutes before the screen began to blink and stop responding to any touch on the screen or the button. Sent it back, at my own expense, and had a new one sent out. They did send an extra battery to sort of reimburse me for the shipping costs, which was good because the battery that was on the second watch when it got here exploded shortly after being turned on, but thankfully didn't damage the watch. The description for the item is a little unclear. This doesn't work WITH your smart phone, it IS a smart phone. It needs it's own sim card to be able to use all the functions, My friend almost had me send it back again because the touch screen isn't very sensitive at all. She says it will randomly stop responding to touch when used regularly. For the most part she doesn't really use it because of how frustrated she gets with it being glitchy all the time.",0.0

It feels cheap. Not so with this phone! It feels like a high end phone when you hold it, and it operates as one also. I left it laying on the lunch table at work and a colleague came over and picked up saying ""Nice!"" and in his other habe he held his $600 LG phone. When I told him it was as $200 phone he said ""Yeah, right. Seriously?'Yes. It has that feel a premium phone has so this is all I can ask for in a phone and then some and a steal at $200!

(Model#: X511 BLUE)",Posh Mobile,69.99,3,"As someone who just wants a good *small phone*, for making phone calls, I found myself buying this one because it was literally the only small phone I could find (the phone I replaced was a bar phone the size of a Chicklets box). Every other option available now is either a smart phone or cheap flip-phone garbage.So I chose this phone entirely for its size, not because it's a smart phone (keyboard way too small to type on), and I was very pleasantly surprised at the call quality on the handset and when using bluetooth. I *DO* recommend this phone if you just want something small for making calls, but don't get your hopes up.Having said that, you get what you pay for:- The pictures provided by the manufacturer are *very* misleading, showing a standard Android Launcher screen, when in fact this phone has a cheap, custom UX that tries and fails to look like iOS.- For no discernible reason, this custom UI doesn't use Android standards — for example… - There is no Apps Tray, and instead all your apps are on your homescreen whether you like it or not - It has a Recent Apps button, but it's inexplicably used for Settings instead - Recent Apps is instead found only by holding down the Home button- The paltry user guide has *no* instructions of any kind about this nonsense custom UI, so you're completely on your own for figuring out stuff like how to reach Recent Apps, so good luck figuring out how to add widgets or rearrange the home screens (tap and hold on empty spot of Launcher)- Instead of using the perfectly fine Android Contacts app, there's a custom contacts app that leaves a lot to be desired- You can't edit or delete Contacts stored on your SIM card (but you can add new SIM contacts) - (You'll have to download ""SIM Contacts"" by PenumbraApps from Play Store - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.penumbra.apps.SIM_Contacts_Manager- The maximum volume on the handset isn't loud enough- The maximum volume on the speakerphone *really, really* isn't loud enough- You can't change lock screen background to pic — you're stuck with what they give you- Because of screen size, keyboard is nearly impossible to type on - Download ""TouchPal,"" which is a) the best keyboard for Android anyway, b) allows you to resize it (I can type on this one)- Status bar shows mobile & wifi signal strength, but *doesn't show bluetooth status* (again, silly custom UI) - However, there is a Power Control widget you can put on the home screen for that- The battery monitor is wildly inaccurate- If you keep your phone numbers on your SIM, the Direct Dial widget thinks *every* phone number is a mobile phone, and you can't change it- The accelerometer is sketchy — when pulling phone down from face during call, screen comes on only about 1/10th of the time - Worse, power button doesn't start up the screen during calls about 60% of the time eitherIf anyone else made decent small feature phones anymore, I probably wouldn't have even looked at this one. But if you want a small phone with decent call quality, you're pretty much stuck with this.",5.0

258200,"Motorola XT-910 DROID RAZR Unlocked GSM Smartphone with 8 MP Camera, Android OS, Wi-Fi, and GPS--No Warranty (Black)",Motorola,240.0,5,"I purchased the DROID RAZR last week and I like it a lot. Previously i owned a Nokia X6, which is also a terrific phone but a little slow by modern standards. I ordered it by standard shipping from Best n Price and surprise surprise.. they sent it the next day.. which was GREAT. I was a little skeptical as this phone is without warranty and looked a little expensive. Now,ABout the Droid Razr -Razr = Gorilla Glass + Kevlar + 7.1mm thick (or should i say SLIM) + 8MP camera, no need to say more about the build. Its nearly perfect.The Razr is pretty fast and the iphone looks dwarf as compared to this. The interface is also customized and pretty cool with the 5 home screens moving in a 3D. Apps on the Homescreens can be resized, removed by a quick hold and flick of the finger (Home screens are just too cool). Android phones are all about apps and there are plenty of cool and useful apps to be downloaded from the android market which is a great asset.MOTOCAST -I found Motocast, the software that can sync the Droid Razr and ur laptop, pretty interesting. In the beginning it takes sometime to get used to, but once u know how it works, makes just freakin cool to download and watch, listen anything thats on my laptop ANYWHERE, yes, ANYWHERE provided the laptop is ON.SMART ACTIONS -Yes, this is one of the most useful app in Moto Droid Razr. Customize and make own schedules to switch on Wifi, save battery by dimming brightness when not charging, change the ringtone volume, modify screen timeout automatically. All this works in a Trigger and Action fashion which is easy to understand and conserves a lot of manual effort. AWE***SOMEI tried skype on Wifi, video was great without lag but a little echo in sound. Processes and Tasks can be monitored with pre-installed apps, which I like to do even on my laptop.BATTERY-Yes, it takes you through a day easily but needs charge in the night.With all my daily tasks like Calls , Chatting (almost Whole day), browing in the evening or whenever i get time I can easily squeeze 12 -14 hrs from the Moto Droid Razr and be still left with 20% of the battery. Definitely a continuous use can drain it in 8 hrs. but the charging time is 1.5 hrs (Pretty less)SIGNAL STRENGTHI read in a review that the MOTO Razr can catch a signal in the most remote areas and the worst places. Voila, thats just what I wanted, I work in a place where I never used to get signal, but Droid Razr catches almost 3 - 4 bars. Sometimes it searches for the signal but very rarely. This is one of the best things about this Razr. Even the iphone (or any others I have seen with my colleagues) with a better service provider catches only 1-2 bars.PROS - Big screen, Connectivity, Build, Motocast, Smart actions, Interface, Cool Apps, Sound, Calls, Fastest shipping I have seenCONS - OS 2.3.5 (need the latest one ICS), No Micro SD card (with this model), Battery (could have been better), No warrantyI never write long reviews but this one deserves it.Simply said.. THIS is a great phone and worth every penny. I love my Razr.Edit:I received the ICS upgrade (Europe version) last evening and its been working great (I am in US). This phone is amazing after the ICS upgrade. Just a little heads up to anyone who is going to upgrade to ICS, the process (download and install) might take long (between 30 min to 2.5 hrs) but it will eventually upgrade and start the phone. My phone looked like it was stuck on ""Starting Applications"" screen for 2 hours but it finally worked and I am on ICS now.The RAZR just got a whole lot better. I will also recommend using the GO Launcher EX from Android market, it makes this phone simply awesome.More Update after 2 days of ICS use. I will keep this short -Pros:1. Better Battery Life (Under same conditions, earlier I used to have 40% at the end of day (10-11 hrs), now I was left with 60%)2. Amazing UI and the phone interface simply looks great. The whole experience is more Fluid.3. Feels more faster, i think there have been performance improvements.Cons:1. Task Manager is gone. There is no Default Task Manager. (Third party ones can be downloaded)2. Signal Strength has dropped one bar. (Still Its much better than a lot of major brand phones, my colleagues complain about signal loss, while i still enjoy signal in those places)TIP: Some people have complained that they cannot find option to ENABLE/DISABLE Background Data. The ""Restrict Background Data"" option is present in ""Data Usage"" Settings when options Key is pressed on the phone.(There is a bug while controlling this through Smart Actions, I encountered it once)Overall, from my viewpooint, they addressed major issues of battery life (i never had an issue here), better UI, higher performance. So, ICS is definitely recommended for Razr.",42.0

367635,"Samsung Galaxy S6 G920I Factory Unlocked Cellphone, 32GB, Platinum Gold",Samsung,319.99,5,"The main reason I chose this phone was speed, and S6 has that in spades. I write software for a living and tried many things to keep my old phone fast, yet despite sticking with Android 2.3.3 and refusing to update apps or install much of anything, web browsing had become an act of click a link and wait 1-5 minutes for it to load, then the screen would stall repeatedly as I tried to scroll through to read the page. If I had to click another link, the waiting process began again. Although other apps on the phone were reasonably fast, web sites had bloated enough that browsing was intolerable with a phone released in 2010 and many sites would not function correctly unless I updated the browser and made things even slower. The same sites on S6 work great, are nearly instant to load, and there's no lag at any time. It's amazing.I went from a Google G1 to G2 (HTC Vision) because I didn't want to lose a physical keyboard, but I'm happy to say that the screen on the S6 is so large that I have no problem typing accurately without a physical keyboard. The screen clarity and resolution are insane. Some big-name reviewers claim there's no point in having so much resolution, but it's really a joy to see tiny, clear labels with extra info in various apps, to look at photos with absolutely no pixelation, and to remote-control other computer screens with no loss of detail. The S6 at 2560x1440 pixels has more resolution than my desktop monitor at 1920x1200!The camera is even more impressive with its 5312x2988 max resolution. It's got enough res to virtually zoom in to 8x during photo or video recording without complete loss of detail. The camera beats my Canon Vixia HF100 1080p camcorder by a mile with better resolution and much more detail in the lightest and darkest areas. Big review sites say this is pretty much the best phone camera on the market and it's nice to always have a good camera with you for unexpected shots. Even the focus speed is far faster than the camcorder and the phone has a built-in ability to do awesome things like stitching panoramic shots together as you pan the phone across a landscape or taking shots with multiple focus points and combining them to make everything clear. Of course the camcorder can still zoom farther with optical zoom to catch distant wildlife so the phone isn't a complete replacement for it.Review sites consistently say the big negatives on the S6 are its battery and its delicate glass and aluminum construction. The construction can be fixed with a case like Spigen Capsule Ultra Rugged, but I was surprised to find the battery can also be fixed with a few tweaks that weren't mentioned by all those big professional review sites. During the phone's initial setup screens I chose to set up a Google account, but did not set up a Samsung account or enable any Samsung features it gave options for. I also declined sending usage/diagnostic info to Samsung or Google. The first night I went to bed with the phone fully charged and pretty much only stock software installed and it was down to 56% the next morning. Terrible! Using Settings > Applications > Application Manager, I disabled the following apps and battery drain went from around 44% that first night to 3% the next night!ANT Radio Service, ANT+ Plugins Service, Briefing, Dropbox, Facebook, Gmail, Google Partner Setup, Google Play Books, Google Play Games, Google Play Movies & TV, Google Play Music, Google Play Newstand, Google+, Hangouts, Instagram, Live Weather, Memo, OneDrive, Photo Screensavers, Print Spooler, S Health, S Voice, Samsung Galaxy, Samsung Link Platform Connect, Theme Store, Virtual tour, Weather DaemonBased on what I've read, these are all safe apps to disable. In fact, unless you root the phone, I don't think the phone will let you disable anything unsafe because the disable button was greyed out on about half the things I looked at. Now I don't know which of the above apps are the real battery hogs, so if you see something up there you actually want to use, hopefully it won't kill your battery to enable it. The phone also comes with a ""Smart Manager"" app where you can click ""RAM"", then ""Manage Apps"" tab and set particular apps to be killed 10 minutes after the screen is turned off. So if you find a particular app is killing your idle battery, adding it to the list might help. It doesn't look like you can add any of the stock software to the ""auto stop"" list, unfortunately, but maybe if some of the things above were enabled they would appear on the list.Over the next few days I installed all my usual apps, including Avast! antivirus which I was worried about, and the phone remains blazing fast and still loses almost nothing with the screen off. In fact I think it was 73% when I went to bed and 73% when I got up this morning. Batteries don't lose power linearly so it doesn't seem unreasonable that it's sticking in the 70s.I kind of wish they'd have given it a larger battery anyway, since most of its competitors have larger batteries, but that would have added to the weight and for my use, the current battery seems to be more than enough. I don't go out a lot or spend much time using my phones, but when I do have a bit of down time, it will be nice to browse the web without the horrible lag. The other thing that worries me is previous phone batteries have always swollen after 2-3 years and forced me to replace them. This is mostly due to bad phone hardware not limiting the battery charge so extra current just gradually damages and swells the battery. I eventually worked around it using Tasker to turn the charger on/off using an X10 module and keep the phone between 70-80% charge. I've had zero swollen batteries since then and will do the same thing with the S6. But for those that always leave it on the charger to keep it at 100% most of the time, I'm worried the battery will swell and crack the glass back of the phone. Hopefully Samsung has set the charger system up to prevent that but it was a big problem with my last two phones. I recommend trying not to leave the phone near 100% charge just in case.Another reason I wish they'd put in a bigger battery is that the phone would be thicker and they wouldn't need to leave the camera sticking out of the back. Having the camera like that is ridiculous and forces everyone to buy a case that protrudes enough to protect the camera from slapping down on a hard surface and cracking. That camera is definitely by biggest fear when it comes to damaging this phone and I'm sorely tempted to buy a case that covers the back with thick rubber right up to near the edge of the camera. Yet that ruins the beauty of the phone's back so the camera design just sucks. I've never bothered with cases on my previous phones because I so rarely drop them, although they've each survived a few falls over the years, but the S6 looks so fragile I ended up using Spigen Neo Hybrid EX to give it some protection and to prevent the camera from contacting a table surface when the phone is on its back. The case has feet at all four corners that give it enough thickness to prevent the camera touching, but if any of the small feet end up off the table the camera still touches, which is annoying. I had to add extra padding to CHOETECH QI Wireless Charging Pad to keep the camera from scraping on it.If you do need a bigger battery there are cases you can buy with a battery built in. Such cases do add weight and usually block the wireless charging ability of the phone, though it would make sense if they developed a battery case that could charge itself wirelessly.Fast charging:I doubt I'll use it much, but the phone comes with a special ""adaptive fast charger"" that will take the phone from 5% to about 50% in 30 minutes by dumping in 9V instead of the usual 5V. Charging speed is reduced the closer the phone gets to full. The fast charger is supposed to detect what it's connected to and operate at 5V on normal devices, but I read that someone plugged it in to a PS4 controller and fried the controller. They repeated the experiment 3 more times (dishonestly returning the broken controllers to the store to exchange for new ones) and it happened every time. Of course, maybe the guy was lying to get attention or had a defective fast charger, but he sounded serious so I figured I'd pass on the warning not to risk using the fast charger on anything other than the phone.Wireless charging:Samsung seems to have put its charging coil at a slightly non-standard height in the phone because every upright wireless charger I looked at had complaints that the S6 would only charge on its side or upside down. The CHOETECH charger I link above had the fewest complaints, but the phone still doesn't always link with it in the upright position. Interestingly, when I added the Spidgen bumper ""case"" to the phone, it connects to the charger with pretty much 100% reliability so maybe Samsung had their thinking cap on assuming almost nobody would use the phone without a case and they positioned the charging coil so it's appropriate only with a case. Still, I think the coil is barely within alignment tolerances and so the phone charges slowly. Also note that although I've seen sellers of wireless chargers claim they can ""fast charge"" the phone, the charging coil in the phone is not physically able to take in power as quickly as the 9V wired fast charger can put out. In fact, I've seen complaints that wireless charging can't always keep up with the amount of power this phone uses to play video or do other things with the screen on. I have a feeling that's because the charging coils aren't aligning well and/or the phone hasn't been tweaked to limit the amount of background crap it's constantly doing with some apps.Rooting:Samsung has special hardware protection that will permanently mark your phone as compromised if you root it using most methods, though there are some ways around it. When your phone gets marked, they call it ""blowing the KNOX fuse"" and supposedly if that happens you can't use Samsung Pay and your warranty might be voided. I've rooted my previous two phones but haven't generally found the extra ""powers"" to be useful so I'm leaning towards leaving the S6 stock.Thumb-print scanner:This is a very cool way of protecting your phone from unwanted users, although it's really a false sense of security. It will likely guard against friends or family mucking with your phone, but a thief (or a techie friend/family) can reboot the phone holding power, volume up, and home button to enter a bootloader mode where they can overwrite the boot loader and get at the phone's data. So the thumb scanner and the ""find lost device"" features might slow or stop someone who doesn't know what they're doing, but a real thief will turn off the phone as soon as they have it and never boot it to let you find it again. Anyway, the thumb scanner itself is decent but I seem to hit it at the wrong angle at least a third of the time and have to carefully move my thumb to be perfectly straight and centered on the scanner. I thought maybe if I moved my thumb to various slight angles and off center during thumb print training it might help but it seemed to make it worse. Then I thought maybe I could set up three versions of my thumb - straight on, slightly left, slightly right - but you can only program four finger prints total. So I trained it for both my thumbs and one index plus one for my wife. It's a disappointing limitation. Using the thumb scanner is reasonably fast when it works, but it feels slower than a simple pattern I used with my old phone, so I'm not sure if I'll stick with it.You can wake the phone by pressing the thumb scanner button but if you don't lift your thumb off and put it back down after pressing the button, it never scans it as a valid thumb print. This is very annoying. We also discovered that if you fail to scan your thumb too many times, the phone locks down and _requires_ you to type the backup password. I'm not sure how many failed attempts turn on lockdown, but my wife caused it to happen on a trip when she repeatedly unlocked the phone to take photos. If you don't have your unlock password memorized and it's written on a paper at home, this could ruin a trip. This ""feature"" is even more annoying in that it doesn't say the phone has disabled the thumb scanner. Instead it shows the normal lock screen but when you put your thumb down it does nothing - no unlock and no vibrate to indicate it didn't recognize your thumb. I thought maybe my thumb scanner had broken but after typing the unlock password it's worked fine for days.In ""Settings > Lock screen and security > Secure lock settings > Smart lock"" you can enable other methods of unlocking the phone. These include saying ""OK Google"" in your voice, having the phone at a particular known GPS location, having the phone paired to a trusted bluetooth device (car, watch, etc), or having the phone up against an NFC (Near Field Communication) sticker. Of course, if you tell the phone to remain unlocked when near your watch, and a thief demands your watch and your phone, well... You can also tell the phone not to lock as long as you're holding it or have it in your pocket. I have no idea how it knows when you're holding it or have it in your pocket, but the description of the feature claims it knows that somehow.""Gold"" vs ""Platinum Gold"" color:The Amazon listing shows a choice of Gold vs Platinum Gold color. I picked ""Gold"" and was excited to finally be getting a gold phone, but the box that arrived showed ""Platinum Gold"". ARGH! Researching online, it appears the S6 is only made in 3 colors: Black, white, and platinum gold. So the ""Gold"" option on Amazon is a mistake. The phone has a hint of gold to it in certain lights but most of the time it looks silver and the gold tone is never more than subtle.Overall an amazing phone. Screen and camera quality are perfect. My only complaints are smaller than average battery and the camera that sticks out the back. For my uses, the battery size doesn't matter. If I ever crack the camera due to its ridiculous sticky-outy design, I'll probably come back and knock a couple stars, but for now I'm happy.",4.0

You do loose some memory, and the back camera is not as many pixels, but It is a Samsung, So even the mid range Samsung cameras on phones are better than other phones with more pixels that cost much more, but that's a whole different issue. OK so I am using these with Straight Talk, It takes the micro SIM card (and can hold up to a 128GB micro SD card.) you just need to call them and if you already have an account its like 4 bucks for the SIM card and free overnight shipping if ordered before like 2pm or something. Or buy one at Walmart.The Finger Print scanner: Felt the need to do this review for this reason.As I know 5 other people that bought this phone, and 4 out of the 5 were telling me how crappy the scanner feature is. The scanner is the BUTTON, not the screen. The screen is for viewing and yes you can touch it, however it cannot scan anything. It is the middle home button that has the biometric scanner in it. The screen arrows do make it look like you should swipe the lower middle part of the screen.(but that is because they cant make the arrows go past the screen to the button) So if you were having this problem, Go to settings, fingerprint scanner, and re-do it the setup using the button and when you swipe, you are not supposed to try to get your whole finger print like taking a finger print on paper from the tip all the way down, you only want to scan the center part of the finger/thumb you are using(shoot for a spot on your finger you can aim and hit every time), as currently it allows up to 3 prints , as i have each thumb as that is how i hold it to unlock it and then a pointer for backup or if the phone is flat on a table or something. See how the feature works once set up and used the correct way, I'm sure its probably in the user manual, but then again I didn't even open that, nor did anyone else i asked that was complaining about the scanner. So this maybe in there, but I seen so many people complaining when talking about this phone, and 4 out of 5 people I knew personally all were doing the same thing wrong. So i hope that helps someone.Overall this is a great phone, not top of the line like its big brother, not as much memory, or pixels in the back camera. but the average person wouldn't even notice the differences anyway when using the phone. I would recommend this phone to anyone who asked me, I would buy it again today in a heartbeat!",91.0

The menus on it are to complex for someone who just wants to pick up the phone and dial. For example, after a txt msg is received, the user must do something with it (either read, delete or answer no) even before they can make a call.Last, and maybe most important, their customer service is aggravating to say the least. The number we were assigned had been used by a business previously and received many txt msgs and calls. When customer service was contacted they first said they could not change the number unless the calls were harassing. Finally after 15 minutes a level 2 person came on the line and after another 15 minutes they decided they could change the number. By that time I decided to cancel the phone so another 15-20 minutes were spent, and 2 more trips to a supervisor, before they would cancel the non-contract phone.All in all a poor experience for me in setting up the phone and my mother's attempt to use it.",15.0

On the package it was stated that the phone can ONLY be used with AT&T network. I visited an AT&T store where the sales rep told me in no uncertain terms that the phone is locked to AT&T and cannot be unlocked because it is not a smartphone. At this point I initiated a return with CellularGlobe. I did not want to try the phone because CellularGlobe return policy does not allow returns if the phone was ever ""used"". Next day I got an email from CellularGlobe stating that the phone is in fact unlocked, and if not they can provide the unlock code. They also assured me it is okay to try the phone, and that I can still return it afterwards. They were right about the former. My T-Mobile SIM card worked with the phone instantly. There is some AT&T software installed on the phone, which I am still unsure how to remove. The phone seems as advertised. I give 3 stars as I feel that the product description must mention that the phone comes in as an AT&T GoPhone, and that it is actually unlocked.

But the phone I received had a weird stain on the back, idk, and the speaker made this weird crackling noise, I thought the phone might be water damaged, but the phone itself is really nice. It runs 5.1 lollipop after updating it from KitKat, lollipop update runs smooth as butter on the phone.OK let's talk about the camera. The quality isn't 4k but it gets the job done, the camera runs really smooth and has great photo editing tools. One of my favorite features of this phone is, if you twist the phone twice, it automatically turns the camera on, its great for when you want to get a quick pic.Other features are the voice activation feature, you can name your phone what you want. Also when you say the name it automatically starts the voice control, even when the phone is on standby. I use the feature all the time for directions, music, and just to ask questions.Build QualityThe phone is very solid and feels really nice in the hand. I don't use a case and I've dropped it a few times and yet no cracks. But I recommend a case and a screen protector. Like I said before it looks like a small iPhone 6 but smaller. Most people like big phones but this phone is perfect size for my hand. I can text comfortable with only one hand (unlike iphone 6) and just feels good.The reason I dropped it a star I because the specific phone I got had some flaws and the seller didn't tell about them. Like I think it has water damage because the phone makes these weird crackling noises sometimes. And theres a weird stain on the back that won't come off. Even with alcohol wipes lol.The price is really good for this phone. This phone runs the same software as 600 $ phones!Overall I would buy this again. Love the phone. I hope this review was helpful.

It never got connected thru LTE but still an acceptable experience. Then I started traveling (the main reason I got an internationally unlocked phone!) and it stopped working. Before I ordered I checked the cell network bands and all communication related information, which BTW is missing in the tech description of the product. I'm an engineer and worked several year in telecoms so I think I know how to buy a cell phone but data connection never worked out of the US (same SIM I used in US, different one, local company one, tried everything!). So, if you are intending to use this phone for traveling... think twice. I sent it back (good experience sending it back and getting reimbursed).",9.0

I got this phone early August and was already having power/lock button response issues 2 weeks after I received the phone. I kept the phone in cool environments, never dropped it and never rooted it. After two months of ownership the phone goes into a boot-loop and forces me to do a hard reset in order for me to even gain access to the home screen. LG US wouldn't warranty the phone out due to it being an international product and the third party offered no refund of any sort and was patronizing to boot. It is now October and the power/lock button has now completely ceased to function. This H860 model is actually a sub-par, cheap version of the G5. I would not recommend ANYONE to buy this phone or from this third party.",3.0
