125686,BLU Life 8 XL Smartphone - Unlocked - Global GSM - White,BLU,125.99,1,"i hate it. Horrible phone, processor, and customer service. It says upgradeable to Lollipop, but when i call customer service 7 times, finally someone from overseas (even though the HQ is in Florida) picked up and started giving me unskilled excuses of why it is NOT upgradeable to lollipop currently because ""lollipop has issues and BLU is waiting for google to fix those issues."" When i repeatedly asked when they expect lollipop to be released for BLU, the customer service guy throws out out an uniformed guess of ""30 days"". That means, i will be stuck with the phone if they don't release it in 30 days because the return policy is only 30 days. Even though the prices is nice, the phone is horrible. I guess you do get what you pay for................sad case.Some issues experiencing: Phone restarts by itself without me pushing buttons; processor extremely slow that it takes about 30 to 50 seconds to capture a picture or send a message - this makes it much worse because user assumes he/she didn't take pic or send text, thus repeats the same action several times and freezes the phone. Screen UNRESPONSIVE to tough. VERY CHEAP plastic casing and parts. Phone is incapable of multitasking with multiple apps open.",2.0

318485,Samsung Galaxy J7 J700M 16GB Dual Sim LTE Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - White (International Version),Samsung,227.14,5,"Before buying this phone, I bought and returned 2 other phones: ZTE and Honor 5x. This one, the J7, is a keeper. I can't see anything negative about it so far.Appearance: looks great, perfect 5.5"" basic HD display. Because it's plastic rather than metal, it's not heavy. It's very slim so can fit nicely in your pocket or small handbag.Performance: finally a phone that pairs and keeps Bluetooth connection, rather than drops it after 10 minutes (which plagues many Android 5.1 devices). Reception seems fine, not better or worse than other phones, my signal showing around -73, the same as other phones. Call quality was perfect, clear, loud on speakerphone, and the other party had no difficulty hearing me either. It has been documented that plastic phones are better than metal when it comes to signal. As I look for a phone that works well as a ""phone"" rather than everything but, signal and call quality are super important to me.Camera: can't go wrong with 13 mp back camera. Clear, sharp photos that you can edit with the help of many photo apps out there. And because of the nice, crisp screen, your photos look good.Battery: 3000 mAh seem to last forever. It comsumes Zero power at night on standby. Charged it to 100% before going to bed and in the morning it's still 100%.I like the fact that is has a micro sim (2 slots) rather than the invisible nano, which I will probably lose within 2 seconds of handling it never to be found. Huge expansion storage on micro sd card, which cleverly slides on top of sim 1 to save space.My phone was purchased ""used, like new"" from JP Mobiles, arrived very fast, as new looking as can be. It was a little over $200, which is great price for a fantastic phone, when you think that people shell out a thousand bucks for a phone that may not be any better than this one.",18.0

265508,"Nokia E71 Unlocked Phone with 3.2 MP Camera, 3G, Media Player, GPS with Free Voice Navigation, Wi-Fi, and MicroSD Slot--U.S. Version with Warranty (White)",Nokia,193.5,5,This phone met my expectations on all levels being sleek and stylish and enhanced communication features which catered for mostly the corporate users rather than the blackberry crazed txtin zombies. While it's main competitors at the time were the blackberrys and iphones in term of feature set it stands out in a class of it's own and has created a niche market where Nokia could find itself.The build construction is simple and unique and it feels sturdy in your hand (from the weight which is not a deterrent). The battery life is also a plus since there aren't many bloatware/heavy OS running in the background that takes out battery power and offers great reception and audio quality in weak signal areas which seems to be a Nokia trademark.I highly recommend this phone even though I bought it a long time back (2009/2010) it being 2013 and I am using it should be a testimony of how it stands the test of time.,3.0

118766,BLU Energy X Plus Smartphone - With 4000 mAh Super Battery- Global GSM Unlocked - Grey,BLU,139.0,4,"First off I bought this phone because I broke the screen on my prior phone. In searching for a replacement, I examined what I used my prior phone to do. I needed something to make calls on, texting and checking email on the go. Yup, thats it. While I previously spent more money for a phone that had blazing fast graphics, top of the line camera, etc. I found I rarely if even used those functions. In that regard this phone meet all my expectations. I could stop the review, but we add few extra details since I did ""downgrade"". The camera is horrible, focusing takes far to long rendering it virtually useless. (I took about 10 pictures in 1 1/2 years on prior phone so not a deal breaker) This phone only has 8GB ram, my prior phone had 32GB, I was surprised how quickly I ran out of space, but 64GB expansion card is only $15. Speaker phone is great, very loud, that being said so is the morning alarm if you forget to set the volume! Plays music and video without any problems, app management software must be well designed I've opened every app on the phone and experienced no hangups or slow downs. I do play one video game that does hangup a little, but still playable, if your looking for something for gaming you'll need to find another phone with more ram. Battery is awesome, streaming music from internet to my Jambox all day (9 hours) and still had 50% battery at end of the night. If the camera had performed better this would have been 5 star review. I deducted 1 star simply because manufactures description doesn't match my experience. Per below ""You deserve top notch picture quality and you will get just that with an 8 Megapixel main camera or the front 5 Megapixel selfie camera."" Camera under performs. I bought and paid for my phone and I'm offering you my unbiased review, hope it helps.***Couple weeks in and still happy with my purchase. I've still had no problems installing or using apps. Battery is gotten even better, I used to charge my Fire Phone at work mid day to prevent my phone from dying, but this phone can go two days with heavy usage no problem!",1.0

266060,"Nokia E71x Unlocked Phone with QWERTY Keyboard, 3.2 MP Camera and Dual-Band 3G (Black)",Nokia,59.99,5,"I use my phone for 1-2 hours of phone calls, an hour of email, and maybe a little web and gps thrown in. I charge it every other day. Things that I like are the basic design, sturdiness and quality. Call reception is excellent. I previously had two Samsungs, and always had numerous dropped calls each day. Reliability of radio service is much better now, which is saying a great deal considering I use the least reliable network (begins with ""A""). It comes with a wired headset and I actually prefer that to my bluetooth earpiece. Sound quality is important. The speakerphone works but isn't loud enough in my car or outside.The keyboard is a little cramped and takes getting used to. The dictionary works great and mostly predicts what I am trying to type. You can add any word to the dictionary easily as you type. I have g-mail and I found both the Nokia mail app and g-mail's own app disappointing. The Nokia app doesn't display html messages without opening a separate browser--not good if you want to quickly scan through messages. The g-mail app opens .pdf files within its program, but loses document formatting. You cannot choose to open an attachment with a program of your own choosing (sounds like the Microsoft strategy is growing within the g-camp). I found ""Profimail"" which works great for me. It works more like a true desktop mail client and can update your IMAP folders so you can carry all your important messages with you. You can download attachments to any location and open them with the application of your own choosing (like Acrobat Reader). The mail client meshes well with the Nokia address book. It is totally software worth trying. I purchased it after only a couple of days of trying it out.There's another default screen app called ""Active Notes"", which I thought would make saving documents a snap, but I was again disappointed. Sometimes I edit emails for people. I copy emails, paste and create a document, edit and then send the edited document back as an attachment that can be copied and pasted into a new email. I tried using Active Notes and it would only attach as a .zip file. I replaced the Active Notes icon with Quick Office, which works well and saves text documents as .txt and .doc.For gps and maps, I use Google maps for Symbian. The gps works quickly and accurately. I'm a guy and wouldn't use turn-by-turn directions even if they were erotically whispered into my ear. I just want to find my location and look at a map. While house-hunting recently, I used it to look at the satellite views too. I recommend Google maps and it's free.The browser mostly works well, and I salute any browser that can display modern web pages on a 240x320 pixel screen. I tried Opera Mini, but didn't see anything better, so I just use the Nokia included browser. Speaking of internet, I also use my phone with the included USB cable as a tethered modem. The Nokia PC Suite of software makes that pretty effortless. Too bad the USB cable doesn't also charge the battery. I purchased a separate USB charging cable that adapts to the charging connector on the phone.There are a few little irritating quirks i found. You can briefly push the power button to switch to different modes, like ""Silent"". Unfortunately the default setting on Silent mode is to not alert or even vibrate upon receiving a call. I missed a whole days worth of phone calls because of that one. I later edited the Silent mode to include a vibrating alert. That seemed a little lame to me.When the phone drops into the standby screen it displays the time without the backlite. When you press the home key, the menu displays and when you press the menu key, the home screen displays--Totally backwards.The mute button is right between the volume keys and you can easily mute your own voice while trying to adjust the earpiece volume if you are not careful.The menus are confusing and completely non-intuitive. Trying to find out how to change something like a hot-key can take a lot of trial and error. An update to the Symbian OS is going to be necessary to keep Nokia competitive.The best case I found is from Beyzacases. They are a Turkish company that makes fine leather cases. I received mine within 3 days of ordering from them.Lastly, the fact that it is unlocked (but works best on US ATT networks) is the best feature of all. You will pay half what you would pay for data if you buy a subsidized phone with a contract agreement. When you remain out of contract your carrier's CSRs will treat you with more respect and care.",4.0

391391,Sony Xperia X Compact - Unlocked Smartphone - 32GB - White (US Warranty),Sony,499.99,5,"Starting off, I'm coming from a Nexus 5 (2013) and I primarily got this phone because the Nexus was getting a bit long in the tooth, so this is a big jump for me in terms of phones and I think it's great overall. I chose the X Compact (over, let's say, the new Moto phones or the Pixel phones about to come out) primarily due to its smaller size as well as its design (though the X Compact was definitely in the upper limit of what I was willing to pay for a new phone); I rather enjoy the simple, clean design of it with the curves along the long edges. Looking at just the specs, it does seem overpriced (I got this at a pretty nice deal, though), but I ultimately enjoy the purchase.My pros and cons are coming from a user that doesn't play games, nor watch too many videos or listen to music too much. I just use it for chatting with friends and communicating with co workers (e.g. text, e-mail, etc), and browsing everyone's favorite news aggregator. Sprinkle in some photo taking, reading the news, and that's pretty much all I use my smartphone for, so my expectations are set accordingly.Pros:+ Clean, simple design with a nice color+ Nice pocketable size+ 720p screen looks great+ Speedy performance for what I need/want+ Dual front facing speakers+ Camera seems nice (I haven't tested it too rigorously yet, however)+ Good battery life (easily lasts me a day with 40% left, but again, I'm not a heavy user)+ Fast charging, and USB C is nice (though I guess I have to get an adapter for all my micro USB chargers)+ Great, lightly skinned Android with 7.0 Nougat updates confirmed (albeit sometime in November, I think?)I can't think of too many cons since I'm not exactly the pickiest, and I'm still in the honeymoon stage with this phone.Cons:- Bit expensive for the hardware you get compared to other phones- Some bloatware that can't be uninstalled, but you can hide them from your apps drawer- Speakers aren't the loudest- Not too many accessories out yet (e.g. cases, screen protectors)Again, I really like this phone, but if you're looking for a phone with top of the line specs or something of comparable specs to this one at a lower price point, you may want to look elsewhere (e.g. OnePlus 3, Moto G4 family, Nexus 5X/6P, etc). I'll try to update this in a month or two, however, when I can probably be a bit more discerning. Hope this helps!",32.0

Rather than go into detail over the phone's features and beat a dead horse (CNET has a very comprehensive review you can read), I'll discuss the ""buying experience.""I purchased this phone from an Amazon Fulfilled vendor called ""The Wireless Circle"" (received it within 2 days via Prime!), It came delivered in a standard Amazon cardboard box and the phone itself in typical Samsung packaging, brand new, with a quick-start booklet, headphones, USB 3.0 cable, and a charging plug. The battery was already fully charged.I am an AT&T customer, but the website and the store were going to charge me $519 plus shipping, and no phones were available within a three-store radius where I live (Hah!). I did some online research and realized buying an unlocked phone was the way to go. I could write an essay on the differences between an unlocked and contract-free phone (just Google it) but if it helps - Since I am an AT&T customer, buying an unlocked AT&T phone meant all I needed to do was take it to the store for activation. Even then, all I needed to do when I got there was replace my SIM card.Ergo: I SAVED MONEY by purchasing an unlocked phone. No more 2-year contracts for me!

The phone comes with everything you need to just walk out the door after you charge up. One piece of constructive criticism. Maybe provide a micro sim adapter for people like myself with micro sim cards. Unless you have the adapter you will have to go buy one before you can use your phone to the intended capacity. This phone is amazing and I am note sure if I am going to sell my note 5 or keep it. This is a well put together phone. Not perfect. I do miss the stylus but the screen size makes up for it.

The screen is 5.5 inches, which makes it a Phablet ( Phone & Tablet = Phablet ). The display is crystal clear HIGH Def and perfect at any viewing angle. Using the Atrium for Netflix streaming movies and a great experience and I've been quite surprised by the headphone sound, although I do link it with my BOSE Bluetooth speaker, so I don't rely on the phone speakers, or the headphone. However, the phone's speaker's are the best, but they are adequate. I would say that the speaker is the only weak point with the phone. The dual SIMM's is nice if you use the phone for personal and work. It's always nice to have 1 phone that handles 2 phone #'s. The APPS load plenty fast and never hangup. I use this for my car's engine performance monitor / Virtual Dashboard with a Bluetooth>> ELM327>>OBD2 Link. All in all, you'll be very happy with this phablet if you use it for Movies, Music and verious apps. I'm not into Video Games, so I cannot comment on how well this would perform.

I expected a significant increase in photo quality going from my previous phones 8 mega pixel camera to this 16 mega pixel camera. I found there was little difference at all in well lit places, although did performe significantly better in low light.-The biggest problem so far.I put a 32 GB SD card in this phone. For some strange reason it reads it as 64, I assume that it is writing over saved information and corrupting files. I didn't notice this at first and lost all photos and videos on the card before I found that out. I know it is not the SD card, as it works perfectly, and is recognized as 32 GB on my other phone and computer.Any help fixing this would be appreciated.",2.0

142790,"BLU Studio 6.0 Unlocked Cellphone, White",BLU,971.6,5,I bought this to just have a bigger phone in my house because I use GSM And can swap out the sim. Didn't think that it would replace My galaxy but it did. At a fraction of the price I can truly recommend this phone. I have spent a thousand on phones in the past and have had about 15 smartphones over the years because of business. A few small tweaks you'll have to do but the everyday person probably won't. The only con I can come up with is that it doesn't have a notification light which is odd seeing that's one of the cheapest things on a phone to put in. Everything seems to be solid from the camera to the quality of the screen. I think its biggest highlight is that there is absolutely no bloatware so it responds faster then better SPECT phones it actually destroys my galaxy in speed. I do recommend you root the phone and at a few things on and you will be extremely happy. final note I think the only thing that really lags on it are some of the browsers like Firefox. It's weird it responds perfect in desktop mode but in mobile mode seems to take twice as long lol I thought that was supposed to save time. But other browsers that I've tried all work fast and honestly Chrome now that it has been updated is a beast on this phone.,1.0

I leave my home at 7:35 every morning to catch a bus and go to school. By 2:15 and using my phone only for music and maybe a few phone calls, the phone is dead again.

335096,Samsung Galaxy S Duos II S7582 DUAL SIM Factory Unlocked International Version - Black,Samsung,299.99,5,"This Samsung Galaxy S Duos II S7582 was a GREAT choice and I am very happy with it.I needed a Dual SIM Phone for my daughter while she is traveling across multiple continents, so I can stay in contact with her, and she can use a local pre-paid SIM card. I only had the phone a few days before sending it out again, so this review is limited to that. She had a GT-S7562 and was happy with it until it was stolen out of her hand in India (Travelers Beware!)Helpful info:Came with Android 4.2, the phone updated to 4.2.2 as soon as I connected it to the internet.This phone has slots for two of the larger SIM cards – not the mini-SIM.My US carrier's SIM card (AT&T) plugged in and worked fine for both Voice and Data. Phone calls and voice quality worked fine. I did not test the data speed on AT&T but it seemed fine. Google Maps worked great using GPS and AT&T data.This is the same size as the Galaxy Mini phones – it just has dual SIM slots.This phone came in a small, factory sealed, Samsung box with: the Phone, plastic back, battery (1500mAh), USB-A to Mini-USB cable (18 inch?), “In ear” style earphones with microphone, and an EU plug wall charger.Pros:Unlocked from Samsung, designed for international use – so it should work with most any WMA/SIM carrier in the world.Great size for travel. Big enough for the Android experience - slightly larger screen than an iPhone but not nearly the size of the more expensive 5 inch phones.Great screen, very easy to read and worked well even in sunlight.Phone worked great. Very responsive. First power up screen asked for the language with a LOT of choices. WiFi connected first time. AT&T SIM card worked first time.Price – paid 158USD with free overnight shipping from Prime.Cons:Battery life - Though I did not get much of a chance to test this phone, all Android phones (smart phones in general??) seem to lose their charge in less than a day. Plan for it.Only 4GB internal Flash.Minor: Wall Charger is an EU Plug. But I have many US Chargers and it is an international phone...I suggest ordering/having the following for this phone:1) Case – I got the 7USD Amzer AMZ95155 TPU case and it works fine for basic protection.2) Micro-SD card – the phone had over 1.5GB available, but for travel (taking pictures, storing music/video) I got the SanDisk SDSDQU-016G-AFFP-A 16GB Micro-SD card for 13USD.3) Additional Battery or portable USB charger.4) International AC Adapter, or Micro-USB power source for charging.Over all I highly recommend this phone and I would buy another one if needed.One last note: This order was fulfilled by Amazon Prime and the seller was “aSavings” – Kudos to Amazon and aSavings for a perfect transaction.",137.0

Drawbacks for me is that there isn't an microSD expansion slot (32GB is pretty large, though); Battery life really sucks (I lose nearly half my charge in less than 8hrs); Bluetooth disconnects frequently while in use; Phone gets hot when using car charger (which is often due to poor batter life).

It took less than 24 (including sleep) to have it set up with my favorite stuff. I continually use bluetooth and I'm REALLY active on my phone. Multiple email accounts and multiple active social media accounts. I can still get a full business day, plus some, on a single charge. Despite also still spending lots of time tweaking.It's said the camera may not be up to those of the flagship phones. I haven't tried the camera, yet, to verify that. But keep in mind that the flagships sell between $500-800+ and the Idol 3 is $250. One would expect a difference. Likewise, with the software. Some things have a perceptible difference in opening speed, but not enough to call them slow. And accessories are limited.In contrast, connections are stronger and faster than any previous device I've owned. I happen to live in an area where signal is weak and maybe a little flakey. There are hills and lots of brick homes blocking the two closest towers. Both cell and wifi are faster and cell strength is better. And it handles a 128 gig microsd card.The Idol 3 isn't a flagship killer. But, at the price, one would expect ""good enough"". And it's much closer to flagship than ""good enough"". If you need the fastest and the best, get a flagship. If you want a smartphone that can stand on its own merits, but allows you to spend your money on more important things, this is what you want.",4.0

I want to keep this phone but the few issues I'm going to have to continue my search for my next phone.Ok I'm a tech guy I like getting the latest and greatest phones when I can. So just to give a background my last few phones were. Asus Zenfone 2 4gb model, Nexus 6, LG G3 and Oneplus one.Pros:Beautiful screen, I like the captive buttons not a fan of on screen buttons I like just pressing back from YouTube and not having to swipe up. Speaker in front love front speakers I miss the nexus 6 because of the great sound but only having one it does sound good. I like the dedicated camera button while holding the phone to snap a photo but while holding the front with your left hand your finger always on it thank God it doesn't launch the camera app everytime you press it. Camera takes better pics than nexus, zenfone has some good manual mode even tho I'm not a crazy photographer. Great 8mp selfie cam.Cons:Qualcomm 810 issues. While changing gets super hot and if you grab it and start using it you can feel the throttling. I've had it restart on me while playing hifi music thru the tidal app while streaming Bluetooth. Don't use popcorn time on this phone I felt it might have blown up how hot it got while using the chromecast streaming a movie. No SD card option and only 32gb available but I never have maxed out one of my phones and I'm a big rom flasher.Design is great I like the build. I got the blue and has like the gold accents which looks great.Last comments I wanted to love this phone but I think the issues with the Qualcomm is really holding it back maybe a update can fix the Issues.

Much to my shock when I went to put the T-Mobile SIM card in it that would give me access to the new T-Mobile internationsl services, the phone rejected the SIM card, and the seller was rude about accusing me of making a mistake. And failed to ever admit that it was a glaring marketing bait-and-switch that his listing would come up when I marked Unlocked as my first level search key, AND the listing contained a discussion of the benefits of unlocked phones.Not wanting to be further abused by and obvious bully, I ceased discussion after I inquired about fast and inexpensive ways to save the wasted purchase for my European trip, and he was not well armed to handle that question, other than to warn against a significant number of fraudulent websites in that space.I still feel the listing was overly deceptive by not being screened by the primary search key, and for caring the collaborating discussion about the benefit of unlock phones, but more appalling was the seller's defensive and bullying attitude. Had he instead been eager to assist an inexperienced buyer to a quick solution, he would have won me over to telling my friends about him, but not in the way I tell them about him today.I was completely unsatisfied, but gave 2 stars to concede that had I had more experience and not been in such a hurry, I could have avoided ordering this product by mistake, by noticing the things he was immediately prepared to pointed out (because this had happened before??? then fix the way the listing is screened for major categories such as Unlocked) about the listings for the product I was actually after.",3.0

To me, this is reasonably priced. It has great features to it. The seller to me was the camera and the screen size. Anyone would fall in love with the camera quality.The downside of this phone, in my opinion, is the dense feeling you get with the phone. It kinda feels like a brick. Also, it can get pretty hot.

I had purchased two BLU Windows phones as gifts last year and I liked the way they performed. So, when I decided to replace my phone, I looked at the different BLU phones. I chose the Life XL because it has a 5.5 inch screen and comes with 2GB of RAM. After I unpacked the phone I inserted a 64GB memory card and a straight talk sim card. It took about 5 minutes to activate the phone and get it running. It took some time to transfer my contacts and sms messages from the old phone but that was because I spent a long time looking for a free program instead of buying one. Now for the phone. I have only been using the phone for a couple of days, so this initial review will be updated in the future. The screen is bright and has good color and resolution. The 13 mp camera takes pretty good pics and the processor handles basic functions like social media and web browsing. The wifi connector locks onto my home network fast and stays connected. I tried out Hulu and Netflix and the video played without issue and the screen was excellent. The speakers aren't the greatest but they are loud. They sound a little tinny when turned up but are not horrible. The sound is OK for calls. So far, I really like the phone. The larger screen makes typing and watching videos easier. I haven't had a chance to try out all its features yet but will update this review after I do.",7.0

259278,Nextbit Robin Factory Unlocked Phone - Midnight (1-Year U.S. Warranty),,249.99,5,"The phone is great. Great performance, and feels very well built. I was afraid the sync to Nextbit own cloud storage could cause issues, or sluggishness, but not at all. The default setting for the Nextbit cloud backup is to sync only on wifi. The idea of the 100GB of free cloud storage is great, but it does only support storing pictures and apps, which are both already backed up/synced by my google account. One advantage compared to unlimited photo storage in google photos is that the Nextbit sync backs up the photos in the original resolution, but it would be much more useful if the 100GB could be used to sync or store any file format (dropbox or google drive like), or at least video files. Until that happens I wish the Robin supported the MicroSD card I had in my old phone. Camera is good, Stereo speakers very good. The main reason I bought it was that it seems to support evey possible band and frequency in the world. Sofar I have activated it on metropcs, and used it with a freedompop global data only SIM card (really a ThreeUK SIM), in both cases it gets a great and steady signal either LTE or H. Much better than the previous phones (Nexus 4 and LG G2). Battery life: good sofar, no problem lasting through the day. During the initial setup it updated to Android 6.0.1",0.0

My daughter has been taking pictures with it, and to tell you the truth, sometimes I think they are better than my Note 2 (sans flash). There is an issue with the internal memory being only 4 gb. I did get around it but it requires rooting the phone. That's not too hard thanks to Motorola. Once I did that, I bought ""link2sd"" in the google play store which really helped with space (sd card, too, of course). DU speed booster also helped clean up some crud, and then, I went into the system files to delete old copies of android system apps that have been updated by google play as well. If you do that (it's not really that hard), you have a phone that's just about as good as anything twice or even three times the price as the Moto E. What a great phone, and it's unlocked, too!",

265494,"Nokia E71 Unlocked Phone with 3.2 MP Camera, 3G, Media Player, GPS with Free Voice Navigation, Wi-Fi, and MicroSD Slot--U.S. Version with Warranty (White)",Nokia,193.5,3,"I did lots (and lots and lots) of research on the e71, which was my choice to replace a Blackberry Pearl I'd had for a couple years. I needed to buy unlocked because 1.) my BB died one day, and 2.) I'm stuck on T-mobile. Because iPhones aren't ""officially"" unlocked, I settled on this e71, which seems to be Nokia's iPhone alternative.After the giddiness of having a new phone wore off, I became more and more disappointed in this phone. It is certainly no iPhone (which my wife has), and isn't much better than my old Blackberry. Call quality is the best feature. That's about it.Because Nokia has not updated the firmware for North American versions (e71-2 models, i.e. this one I bought from Amazon), there are a number of very annoying bugs in the operating system. Strike 1: The OS routinely crashes and reads ""Memory Full"" when it definitely is not full, and the only way to stop the warning screens from appearing is to reboot. Strike 2: The enclosed app for corporate email, called ""Mail for Exchange"" was so bad and difficult to configure that my IT guy and I finally gave up and bought a $50 RoadSync application that works OK. (As a comparison, it took my wife approximately 3 minutes to configure her iPhone for corporate MS Exchange email.) Strike 3: The phone sometimes makes an awful popping sound when playing keypad tones or application chimes, It is like the clicking and popping sound you get when speakers overload or get too much signal. Others have experienced this on the Nokia support boards, as well, and it may be a hardware issue.OS bugs aside, there are also significant hardware disadvantages of this piece compared with the iPhone. The screen isn't wide enough to see a full line of sender, date, and email subject on the screen. You have to guess sometimes at what the message might be. This makes the chances of opening SPAM from the coporate server a lot greater, in my experience. The camera is merely adequate, and mine casts a purple hue to all pictures -- not uncommon, according to other users. I can manually set it to Sepia mode and it looks better, but that's a pain. My wife's iPhone takes great photos as is.By far the most annoying ""feature"" of this phone is in setting up ring tones and alert tones. In the Blackberry, you can indicate how many times you want a tone to ring. It seems that, in this Nokia, it's either ON or OFF. Sometimes I want an alert to ring once, and that's it. Maybe a single chime to let me know about an email or something. The sounds on the e71 just keep going and going until you manually silence them.I bought this phone mainly because I thought Nokia had a reputation for quality and solid phones. It also had a full size, real qwerty keyboard, which I prefer to the screen-based keyboard of the iPhone. The construction of the phone is solid. It has nice build quality. It's pretty. But this and the qwerty keyboard benefit doesn't make this phone worth all the trouble of the other numerous issues.My T-Mobile contract is up in February, and I'm headed to the Apple Store to get an iPhone unless Nokia updates the e71 firmware for N. America. I'll end up selling this one on eBay for a loss, and I'll be happy as a clam to get rid of it. Overall, my experience with the phone as my main corporate and personal communicator has been at the most satisfactory. My apologies to all the Nokia fanatics out there, but the iPhone beats this brick by a mile.",4.0

140176,"BLU Studio 5.0 HD Unlocked Cellphone, White",BLU,119.99,5,"I'm an engineer and a computer enthusiast and wanted a fairly capable smartphone to run technical apps, but I'm also retired and unwilling to spend a lot for a flagship Samsung or Apple smartphone. I did a lot of shopping for mid-range phones and finally settled on the Moto G or BLU Studio 5.0 HD LTE. Both had decent reviews, but the BLU offered 4G LTE support on T-Mobile with a 5 inch screen and the Moto G did not. I was very pleased with the appearance and build quality of the phone. I did have a problem at first that I traced to an intermittent accelerometer, but Amazon replaced the phone with no hassle, and the replacement works fine. I also bought one for my wife, and she really likes it. I should note that this was an upgrade from a basic Samsung (Exhibit 4G) smartphone that we bought about three years ago; so the upgrade was a major one for us. Recommended, especially for those who want a lot of phone for not a lot of money.Update 3/31/2016 - I've had the phone for about a year now and am still quite satisfied with it. I don't believe that new units are available any longer, but it is still a good choice. I've even used it successfully with Google Cardboard for simple VR and 360 video. My only complaint of substance is that this phone is still running Android 4.4 Kitkat, even though Lollipop came out shortly after I purchased it. BLU apparently runs about one Android generation behind current on its new offerings and does not upgrade any but its most top line offerings once sold. I've also searched for independent upgrades from places like CyanogenMod.com, but I've been unable to find any more recent ROMs for this particular model.Update (4/21/2016): Last week, for the first time I can recall, an update came through for both my phone and my wife's. This appeared to fix the ""Stagefright"" vulnerability (per Lookout's detection app) and some other issues (unspecified). It did not update Android to a newer version. The dates on the update packages were Sept 2015 which suggests that they were delayed by 6 months. Since these phones are not sold or supported by T-Mobile or Google, I assume that the updates came from BLU Products, but I didn't see any labeling that said so, and I could find no mention of the update on BLU's website.",0.0

310664,Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime Dual Sim Factory Unlocked Phone - Retail Packaging - Gold(International Version),Samsung,194.9,3,"I purchased this phone because I was looking for the dual sim-capacity. I was getting tired of carrying around two handsets, one for personal and one for business. AT&T is my wireless provider and I took the three handsets to the store and they got the two sim cards installed and activated in the new handset pretty quickly.I had to install custom ring tones to distinguish the two lines because the visual cues are too subtle and I haven't figured out how to change that.For my personal line I was converting from iPhone to android, so I tried to follow instructions I found online to transfer my pictures, contacts, and text conversations from the iPhone to the new device. However, somewhere in the process things quit working and I had to perform a factory reset. Following the factory reset at after about two weeks of moderate use, I haven't even finished acquiring all the apps I use, it became slow and glitchy. I have to restart the phone at least once a day. I hope the OTA Lollipop update comes soon and fixes these problems; after the earlier glitch I am reluctant to root the phone and perform the update manually.After several months of use I consider the phone call quality to be pretty terrible. I don't know how much of that is attributable to the handset and the network, but every conversation involves asking people to repeat themselves because of garbled interference from the network/device. I've only used the device in the lower 48 states and it's ability to detect signals is hit or miss. Sometimes one sim card will have no bars but the other will have four bars. It's the same provider for both sim cards so I'm inclined to say that is a handset issue rather than a network issue.",5.0

331002,"Samsung Galaxy Note II N7100 16GB Android Smartphone (Unlocked International Version), Quad Core, 5.5"" Screen, Dual Cameras (8/1.9 MP) - White",Samsung,288.99,5,"I won't go into deals about the phone because I think others have done really good reviews (read reviews from the gray phone as well) but I will go into details about my experience.Here are few things I want to focus on:1- INTEGRATION: what I mean here is the integration between apps and the main functionality of the phone. I use the calling feature a lot ( expected ) but also I don't want to launch each individual social app to find someone I want to SMS/Chat/Call. Basically it has a ""universal"" contacts so if you use Tango/Viper/WhatsApp/Skype/Google Voice you will find it so easy to find the person and do whatever you want. I make lots of international calls so I use 3rd party app to make phone calls (along with GVoice). I've used this 3rd party with the iPhone but it was buggy and it always crashes plus I have to launch it each time and find a person to call. With Android, I can just configure the app to be used when I call internationally. The same goes for Google Voice.2- NOTIFICATION: I use social apps like WhatsApp alot but with the iPhone it used to drain battery and not work properly with the iOS notification. I've to open it all the time to make sure someone is talking to me. The notification for this phone (probably Android thing) is just amazing. With the power and memory of this phone, all apps just push their notification smoothly. Slide down with your finger from top to bottom and you see all your notifications. It could get annoying but you can always turn it off or silent your phone.3- S-PEN: As others have mentioned, this is probably the best part of the phone. I can't imagine not using it and believe me you will just love it. It has so much features and is very precise when writing. I use it almost all the time.4- BATTERY: I charge the phone at night only. I use it from the time I wake up till I charge it again at midnight. I won't exaggerate if I say that I use it heavily from sending emails, to lots of FB to youtube to all social apps (Skype/SMS/WhatsApp/Viper/Tango) to email and lots of browsing and it will survive till the end of the day. The screen is almost on 75% of the time. I have to say that while it is not a PC but I've not used my PC that much since I got this phone.5- SPEED: with all the points above, switching between all the apps I work with is just blazing fast. No lag whatsoever. It is very fast and loads quickly.6- MULTI-TASKING: You can literally use two apps at the same time (not all apps though). Just drag an app from the side menu to the screen and it will split both ups (top and bottom)7- AUTO-COMPLETE/SENTENCE COMPLETION: it is so amazing smart I literally type few letters and it gives me so many options to finish. It also predicts the next word based on your selection and you type a 15 words SMS in 5 seconds. As an FYI, it does this for more than ONE language I use (English/Arabic). With the iPhone, it was really a piss off. Each time it overwrites what I type and I keep hitting the erase/back key on the keyboard.8- CONTINUOUS WRITING: For both languages I use - again - I just move the S-PEN (or my finger) on the keyboard and it will accurately finish words for me. I am honestly surprised at its accuracy. About 90% of the time it is always correct. English accuracy is higher than when I type in Arabic.9- SIMPLE MOBILE/T-MOBILE: I live in Northern VA and there are so many new towers with the 1900 band. However only when I am next to them I get 3G/HSPA+ but the speed - while driving; I know :) - is about 5.5Mbps down and 2.5Mbps uploads. 99.9% of the time I am on EDGE. I might move to Simple Talk but to be honest I do a lot of SMS internationally. If Simple Talk will cut off my line when sending couple of International SMSs then that would be crazy. The majority of my time is at work or at my home. At work I use the PC so I don't care about 3G/4G while at home I use my Wifi. At the end of the day, you need to really evaluate your needs. EDGE is more than enough for me for email/light social apps.10- TABLET ALTERNATIVE: I would only use a table for reading books since I've 100's of technical PDF books. I've read few large Apress PDF technical books and I can see myself reading from this phone straight. I don't think it will be ideal but it was just so hard on the iPhone since I was constantly zooming in and out.11- FINGERPRINTS: I am not sure if I read some reviews that said it does not get fingerprints easily but this is not true. It is like a magnet and don't listen to their reviews.Finally, I was lucky to get my two phones from Amazon LLC and not a third party seller. I just don't trust these guys for the amount I paid for my phones and I was lucky to get the last two white ones. I've really enjoyed the phone every time I use it and it is worth every penny. I don't think I need to jump to any phone for few years to come (unless I break this, hopefully not).Finally thanks to all the previous 5-star reviewers here at Amazon. They've done really a good job giving this phone with it deserves.",18.0
361904,Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge G925F 64GB Unlocked GSM LTE Octa-Core Smartphone - Gold Platinum INTERNATIONAL VERSION NO WARRANTY,,499.0,2,"Few comments so as not to duplicate too many other reviews.The Pros: The phone itself has some amazing features and the display is beautiful. Incredibly thin and light. The array of sensors to include a pulse ox to signal strength to noise meter functions are both fun and useful. Photos are amazingly clear and beat any other phone I have ever used. My previous iPhone is like a model T compared to this one. This is a polished, beautiful device.The Cons are that my phone was not smooth on some game animations (Osmos) and generally didn't feel as crisp as my Moto X Pure and even my Nexus 5X. What was most troubling however was the signal strength I consistently got. I never get the phone to display that it was receiving LTE (my wife's iphone does in the same place) despite multiple attempts to configure it with AT&T. Wifi reception also was low--usually 2-3 bars or less when my other phones would read 4 bars. This vendor apparently got these phones overseas and quite frankly my phone just didn't seem to work consistently or at least optimally with ATT in the US. The power adapter that came with my unit is internationally configured, so you must use a bulky, nasty looking adapter to make the power adapter work with US plugs. Not a huge deal, but definitely an issue when traveling. The glass back looks beautiful when clean, but its a fingerprint magnet.8/20/16 Update: Its clear that this phone will not be updated to Marshmallow. ATT doesnt recognize the model and there is nothing from Samsung that provides a way to update. The baseband version seems like its completely unsupported, even by those root hackers out there. Its a dinosaur.The upshot for me is that I will be sending the phone back and either re-order to see if I just got a clunker, or I will pay another $200 and buy it directly from AT&T. I think this is a great phone, but not so sure I got a version/model/device that works well here in the US.",

The screen is amazing to watch movies / pictures / browse and the battery life is pretty solid though. The vendor dealt with my issues swiftly though - appreciated it.Pros:* Gorgeous screen - if you can get your hands on 4K HD source it looks incredible. HD movies look also fantastic. This is one of the standout feature of the phone* Great camera* Good battery life (well, for a smartphone - I am still waiting for a smartphone that can last for 3 or 4 days straight)Cons:* BIG software issues: viber, whatsapp, facebook, any app that connects to the internet, are working on and off and wifi calling is often unavailable. the phone I received comes as an unlocked T-mobile phone with some T-mobile app that you cannot uninstall. Not a big deal in theory - but seems like the T-mobile settings get in the way of wifi calling* Other software issue - while in general the phone/android runs smoothly, once in a while the phones freezes / apps shut down / keyboard doesn't pops out when you want to type. Same things started on my Galaxy S2, after 3 years of use. Not right out of the box* SCREEN RESPONSIVENESS ISSUES. Every now and then the keyboard doesn't work. You type but nothing appears on the screen. My sister had a screen responsiveness issue with her LG G2 - the bottom home/back/switch buttons ended up not working after a while, while the rest of the screen was ok. Maybe a specific pb of LG phones? Is it a pb with the screen itself or the software I am not sure.* Power-button: I don't like the power button to be on the back of the phone - much easier if it is on the side. bit awkward to power on/off, especially as the phone has a large body. Same for the +/- sound buttons.",1.0

274926,Nokia Lumia 920 32GB Unlocked GSM Windows 8 Smartphone w/ Carl-Zeiss Optics Camera - White,,99.99,5,"My switch from apple to windows: Let me just say I have never really been a fan of the iPhone. It's just not my personal preference. I know there are plenty of people that like it, but not me...I was worried though switching from my iPhone to something where my app options were going to be completely foreign. Even if I love windows 8 for my desktop - I was hesitant about going to windows 8 mobile. I'm SO GLAD I made the change.Also, here is a novel idea. When I plug this thing into my computer via usb - guess what happens.....I CAN VIEW MY FILES AND MUSIC. I never wanted to resort to jailbreaking my iPhone because it permanently damaged my boyfriend's phone, and another friend we have had a heck of a time with his jailbreak. While this may be a problem that is generally few and far between - being as I was running my phone on a prepaid network and already had issues with that, I didn't want to jailbreak the phone. I shouldn't have to jailbreak a phone that is meant to play music in order to complete the generally simple task of loading music on the dang thing.The actual physical phone: I love the slim & sleek design, the very easy to use touch screen, the sensitivity adjustments for the touch screen, and the overall quality and feel. The screen size is perfect for my use. I was considering getting a tablet before I had this phone, and while this isn't exactly tablet-sized...I may actually skip the tablet for the time being.",

Received the phone quickly. Amazon does a great job with shipping...if they tell you 2 days, it will be 2, if they say 3-5 days, you might get it in 4. The phone is not heavy. Like the apps, but wished there were more like what the iPod and iPhone has. Love the Map, I can download just about any country and it actually shows you where you are without been online and it talks to you while you drive when you put in where you want to go. I had to go away, so I tried it outside of the USA and it still shows you where you actually are. If you need to download the entire USA, you'll need a larger capacity Micro SD card...the USA is large, but you could download which state you need or just search for the address...as I said you don't need to be online to do this.Sometimes when you are at a particular screen it freezes and you have to turn off the phone or the phone turns off without you doing it, otherwise it's okay. For the price, it has a little of everything and some extras that other phones don't have. WIFI is great, I can pick up WIFI virtually anywhere.I had one problem, I could not find any cover and screen protective films except in the UK or China, so now I have to wait for the package. Amazon had two types from another company, which I only liked one and they only had one color available and I need more colors. So I'm hoping Amazon will get the cases, so in the future I can buy more cases and other customers would do the same.Overall the phone is nice and does everything it says it would do.",3.0

I don't know if it just went down hill once Lenovo acquired Motorola from Google or if I just happened to get two phones from the same bad batch. When the first phone started exhibiting ""ghost touch"" a day into using the phone, I contacted Motorola customer support. I asked if there was a firmware or software update to fix the issue. I was told by the agent that the behavior was not typical and to return for replacement. I find no fault with Amazon's replacement policy because they had a new unit sent to me the next day. The new phone started doing the same thing!!! A quick Google search brought up results of others having the same issue with no fix available. The standard answer on Lenovo's support forums is to take the phone to a local repair center.When the phone worked, it was great. Apps were responsive, the fingerprint reader was speedy, and the display was sharp. I really liked using it. However, when the phone started acting up, it would switch screens on its own, open apps on its own, and type on its own. It even called my sister by itself, and I had to explain the wonkiness that just happened. One phone I can justify trying again, but twice in a row, it needs to go back for a refund.",1.0

This review is more about that, rather than the phone, as we've only recently bought the phone. We wanted to get the $30/month pre-pay T-mobile service plan, but they didn't have any good phones available. The customer rep suggested I look for an unlocked phone, and then buy a sim card from them. First, I love that they suggested that. The LG G2 on their other plans was about $350, and here it was about $220. I was able to buy the sim card from them for $2.Getting the phone and text messaging to work was easy. there are instructions in their sim box that we had no issue with.However, when you buy an unlocked phone you do have to do a bit more work to get data. We didn't realize this. To test yours, turn your wifi on and make sure you can still access the Internet. If not, you won't be able to do so when you are out and about. Some searching on the internet and we found that you need to set your own APN (access point name). Once you do this, reboot the phone and voila you have data connection. To find the settings and instructions, do a web search on ""lg g2 tmobile set apn"" and there are several discussion threads that give a step-by-step instruction. the key for us was the APN value and the MMSC value. this might be a bit overwhelming for folks but follow the how-to carefully and you'll be good to go.",0.0

There are still a few, small glitchy software issues - but otherwise functioning properly. I am not sure if it was this individual phone or if all N97s have software issues to start. However, now I am afraid to update the phone software, for fear that it will have more problems. One note: it was difficult to get in touch with support and speak to someone ""live."" I sent the phone in on blind trust without speaking to anyone - but all's well that ends well..._____________________________________________________________________________ORIGINAL REVIEW: I have had this phone since July 3, 2009. Since purchase I have had to deal with one issue after another, all related to the software and application interface. The hardware (physical) phone itself was great.Negatives:Too numerous to list all of them here, but essentially the software and applications are not intuitive and have MAJOR issues. I am fairly tech savvy and I cannot even imagine how someone who is less knowledgeable in this area would be able to deal with this phone. Very high maintenance.--It took me, and several tech geek friends, A LOT of time to figure out how to set up 2 email accounts.--The wireless access would not ""remember"" my wireless WEP key and typing that long# in repeatedly is not fun! It started 'saving' it on its own one day. (see reboot story below - now it doesn't save any more)--Facebook app and ""Favorites"" app won't load onto the home screen (just says ""Loading"" but never does). I tried to reinstall the Facebook app, but had to go to a 3rd party site to find it. Nokia's Ovi store no longer has a FB app available. Once an app is gone from your phone - good luck trying to reinstall it. Impossible. If you can even find the app anywhere.--Apps randomly work, then don't work. Very mysterious.Yesterday I had to do a hard reset back to the factory settings (which means I had to back up and then delete all of my data, photos, text messages, music, and loose all of my settings, including difficult-to-set-up email connection settings, etc), to try and get the non-working/disappeared apps to work. There wasn't much else I could do the software was so messed up. It was the last resort to get the phone to function properly. However, resetting it essentially ""killed"" the phone interface entirely. It is so bad that I just sent my phone to Nokia's repair site in Alabama (their ""customer care"" phone and email are essentially non-existant: phone tree loop and a ""generic"" email response is what they consider ""care."") Now, I am waiting to see if/when they fix the phone. Here is how the phone was ""working"" after the hard reset (that was supposed to bring it back to the original factory settings):--The key pad won't function (on screen) so I can't even try another hard reset.--The phone doesn't work (can't access it).--The camera won't function.--Most of the apps are missing. Including facebook and 'favorites'.--Most of the apps that are still on the phone won't function.--The phone shuts off when connected to the computer to update software.--The phone randomly shuts on and off when you try to access an app.--The 'memory full' message keeps appearing when there is nothing on the phone and there are no apps open.Among other issues...My main concerns about having to mail my new, $700 phone to a far away repair place are:(1) now I am stuck with NO PHONE for ""7-10+ days"" and I am trying to run a small business (ironically enough it is for usability testing of products such as this - and boy does Nokia need to test their N97 interface - have they actually read the Nokia Users Discussion board?), and;(2) the ""Repair form"" instructions for returning the phone state that they will ""call me with an estimate of the cost(shouldn't it be free?!)"" or that they will ""return the phone if it is not repairable."" That's just great. Can you tell that I am really annoyed? The phone cost $700!!!Positives:Nice hardware. The keyboard is easy to use and read. I liked the matte feel of the keys. The screen is large and crisp in terms of readbility, and I love the fact that you can use your finger or a stylus (or finger nail - which you can't do on the iPhone) to activate the touch screen. I love the weight and solid feel of the phone. The silver buttons and edging is also a nice touch. The camera, when it worked, took nice photos that rivaled my digital cameras' pics.The white phone is pretty cool looking - too bad it doesn't work!",6.0
